<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>


<p>I have been urged ever since I left the Asylum, by
friends, to write my history of those two unfortunate
years, and give it to the public. This I did purpose
to do while I was in the asylum, as soon as I left it,
while all things would be fresh in my memory. But
after leaving that place, and mingling again with the
world and with my friends, the very thought of the
subject sickened me, for I desired to think and talk
as little about the matter as possible.</p>

<p>Besides this, in eighteen months after I left the
asylum I entered upon the regular work of the ministry
again, and did not wish, while in the effective
work of the ministry, to mix with it the history of
those two unhappy years, of which I knew, the public
had no adequate conception; and which, if I should
write out faithfully, would develop facts which many
would disbelieve, while others would only laugh at
them, as freaks of my insanity, and not as sober
truths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Another reason which has deterred me from giving
to the world the history of those two years, is the
fact, that a number of inmates of lunatic Asylums in
this country have given to the public their views of
asylum life, and one especially, who was in the asylum
at Utica, and discharged just before I entered it. I
could not help noticing the effect these productions
produced on society. In many instances the history
was read only to laugh, and pity the insanity of the
writer. This case referred to, was a lady from
Syracuse.</p>

<p>The object she had in view in writing her narrative
was evidently lost, excepting the profit she expected
to derive from the sale of the work, which I judge
could not have been great. She was very unfortunate
in writing this narrative; marks of insanity stand
out prominently through all the work in the language
she uses, in the low scurrilous manner in which
she attacks all who differ from her in opinion, her
bitterness to the Church, and its ministers, and
especially her low ribaldry concerning the doctors of
the institution.</p>

<p>On reading this pamphlet, I saw the difficulty
attending the writing a narrative of asylum life by a
patient, however truthful it might be; for, notwithstanding
all the objections that can be raised to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
work above referred to, it nevertheless contains many
truths of an alarming character&#8212;truths which every
sane inmate can testify to. And by the way, it must
not be supposed that every patient in that institution
is insane; far from it; but more of this in its proper
place. And though very much, if not all that is
related in that pamphlet concerning the institution,
is strictly true, yet the manner and spirit in which
it is told, detracts very much from its merits.</p>

<p>Considering all these facts, with some others that
I need not name, I hesitated, and at one time thought
that I would never write one word on the subject.
But notwithstanding all the objections that have
crowded themselves upon my mind to such an undertaking,
I confess I felt myself urged onward to write
the facts as they presented themselves to me; and
this work I have undertaken, hoping that by this
means the public mind may become somewhat, at least,
disabused in relation to lunatic asylums in general,
and especially in regard to the State Lunatic Asylum
at Utica, N.Y.</p>

<p>About three years have elapsed since I left that
institution. Since that time I have mingled with
society as formerly, have ever since I left preached
Christ and the Resurrection as a regular minister in
the church of Christ, have done a little worldly business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
and am still employed in worldly matters in
connection with preaching about every Sabbath. I
would state still further that I have been a minister
of Christ more than forty years, and more than forty
years have been a member of the Troy Conference of
the M.E. Church; and I am positive that during
that long period no charges or complaints have ever
been made against me for immorality, imprudence, or
heresy.</p>

<p>I have been thus particular in describing my present
standing, to show the public that I have not entered
upon this subject as a mad-man, or a man broken
down in society. I am not aware that anybody,
in or out of the church, looks upon me otherwise than
before I went to that institution.</p>

<p>I wish to also state to the public, to the praise of
God, that I have not had a sick day since I left the
asylum. And what will perhaps appear more strange
to the reader, is, that I am prepared to say, and even
to prove, that during the two years and four months
I was in the institution, I never had a sick day&#8212;never
lost one meal, but went to the table three times
each and every day of the two years and four months;
and though over sixty years old when I entered the
asylum, I am positive that I never laid down ten
minutes upon the bed in the day time during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
whole of that time; yet, there were times in which it
would have given me great relief from my rheumatic
pains, could I have done so, but it was not the good
pleasure of the doctors to allow this privilege to me.</p>

<p>I wish to also say, before I enter upon the rather
painful work of narrating the events of my captivity,
(for I can call it by no other name so appropriate,) that
before I went to the asylum as a patient, I was
totally ignorant of the character of these institutions.
I had never heard them described, except in one
instance, and that by a man who was so unfortunate
as to be carried there by force by his neighbors, as
most patients are carried there. He gave me a
most horrible description of his treatment, while in
the asylum; how he was dragged by his hair, beaten
and bruised, and how he finally made his escape and
went home. I heard his sad and tragical tale, but I
disposed of it as most men do, by regarding the whole
story as imaginary, the effect of a disordered mind,
believing that such things could never be tolerated in
a Christian country.</p>

<p>It is true that at the time he related this to me, he
was sober and in his right mind, and was one of the
best of men; yet, I regarded the story at the time, as
the wild freak of a disordered mind. I now believe he
told me the truth. He afterwards died in the asylum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>To show the general impression on the minds of
the outer world on the management of such institutions,
and the treatment of their inmates, I was once
conversing with a man whose neighbor's wife was an
inmate of the Asylum at Utica, and had been for years.
I asked him his opinion on the propriety of keeping one
so many years in the asylum. He gave it as his opinion
that in such public institutions the doctors were
the most wise and skillful men in the world; that
the nurses and attendants were well skilled in the business;
that great care and patience were exercised
over the patients, and that no stone was left unturned
to soothe and comfort these unfortunate victims of
insanity. This certainly was a very charitable view
to take of an institution got up professedly for the purpose
of relieving that unfortunate class of society. I
cheerfully gave my assent to his relation of supposed
facts, and went away feeling gratified that we had in
our State so noble and so humane an institution.</p>

<p>But the sequel will tell how near right he was in
his conclusions, and how near right the public mind is
generally, concerning the most of public or State institutions,
got up ostensibly for the purpose of relieving suffering
humanity. Before my narrative will close, the reader
will have the opinion of one, at least, whether State
lunatic asylums are a blessing or a curse to our country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish to farther say, before I close my preparatory
remarks, that I have no selfish motive to induce me
to lay open my experience during those two eventful
years. It is not for money, of course, that I do it, for
in this respect I shall expect to be the loser; and it
certainly cannot be to let the world know that I have
been an inmate of a lunatic asylum. I do it for the
purpose of opening the eyes of the people of the State
of New York, that they may enquire more strictly
into the nature and workings of the institutions of
benevolence, so called, under their control and patronage;
to warn the good people of the State of New
York to never send their wives, their children, or any
of their dependants to a State institution for the cure
of any disease of body or mind, where the patient is
confined by bolts and bars by legal sanction, and
where the sole power over the patient is vested in one
man, whose word is law, and whose commands are as
imperious as the Sultan's of Turkey. Such is the fact
in relation to the Lunatic Asylum in Utica.</p>

<p>Whatever he orders must be done, and as one of the
supervisors once said to me, to show the absoluteness
of his word, &#8220;That if Dr. Gray should order him to
carry me out doors head downwards he should most
certainly do it, for his word was law.&#8221; I replied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> &#8220;All
right; so if the doctor should order you to kill me you
would do it.&#8221; He hesitated a moment and said, &#8220;No;
I don't think I should do that.&#8221; The idea advanced,
however, was, that the patients must understand that
the word of one man <i>is the law</i> of this institution, and
whoever comes within its walls must bow to this
scepter. And though this institution is under the
supervision of eight or nine managers, it is also true,
that one man, the superintendent or commander-in-chief,
has the sole and undisputed control over all the
patients as soon as they are received as patients.</p>

<p>Enough, perhaps, has been written to prepare the
way for the particular history of the time I was in that
institution, so far at least as my experience and observation
is concerned; and though three years have
passed away since I left the asylum, yet almost everything
that happened within my observation seems to be
indelibly written on my mind, so that they are as fresh
in my recollection as if they had happened but yesterday.</p>

<div class="booktitle">TWO YEARS IN THE ASYLUM.</div>

<hr class="btitle" />



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>


<p>In the spring of 1863, I was appointed
by the proper authorities of the church, as
the pastor of the M.E. Church in the town of
Kinderhook, for the third year, having
served that people the two previous years.
I commenced my new year in good health
and fine spirits; all went on favorably, so
far as I knew, until about the first of June,
when the first shock which I felt which
terminated in my downfall, was but a small
affair in itself, and at first affected me very
slightly, but continued to wear upon me,
until another circumstance, arising from a
little gossip in the village of Kinderhook,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
added to my former trial, threw me into a
diseased state of body.</p>

<p>The circumstances were as follows: As
I had been in the charge the two previous
years, the rules of the church did not admit
of my being returned the third year, and
yet the official board petitioned to have me
returned to them the third year. To effect
this, and to make it legal for me to return,
some alteration or change must be made in
the name of the charge. This was effected
in the following manner: This charge
contained the villages of Kinderhook and
Valatie, lying one mile apart, each having
a church, and each having preaching every
Sabbath. This charge also embraced the
little village of Stuyvesant, near the Kinderhook
depot. The first year I had Valatie
alone; the second year, Kinderhook, which
had been a separate station, was taken in or
connected with Valatie, both now making
but one charge. To effect my return and
make it legal, the authorities at the Conference
dropped the name of Valatie off
from the minutes, and inserted in its stead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Stuyvesant, making the charge now read
&#8220;Kinderhook and Stuyvesant,&#8221; instead of
Valatie and Kinderhook.</p>

<p>This change of names was observed by
some of the friends in Valatie, and they
were highly dissatisfied. I explained the
cause, and told them that the name would
be restored at the end of the year. This
did not satisfy some of them, so the fire was
kept up; not that any change was made in
the work; each had the same service that
they had the previous year. I finally told
them I was sorry I had returned to them,
as they felt so bad about the change of the
name of the charge, as it was done solely
that I might return to them. I told them
it was not my doings; they had asked for
my return, and to effect it this change had
to be made.</p>

<p>So matters went on for a month, and I
supposed all was quiet, and had never heard
a lisp but all were satisfied with me, when
all at once one of the official board told me
that two or three private members of the
church had met to consult on the propriety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of having me removed from the charge;
mixing a little gossip with this, which was
studiously kept from me, until this kind
brother revealed it to me. I was not moved
by it at first; I knew all the official men of
the church were in my favor, and they told
me not to mind what these two or three
had said. This was the first friction I had
ever felt in my ministry.</p>

<p>The leaven continued to work in my
mind; my health began to give way. The
official board visited me, gave me great
encouragement, and offered me money;
said I could rest, and they would get the
pulpits filled until I was better: they did so.
My mind became more and more excited;
friends came from a distance to comfort
me, but all was in vain; little things were
magnified to mountains; I knew that I
was unmanned, and could not tell why;
I imagined things took place that never
existed; my mind took a strange turn; I
imagined I was the worst of beings, and
that thousands must suffer on my account.</p>

<p>I soon became exceedingly restless;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
wanted to be constantly on the go; wanted
to be constantly doing something, and
hardly knew what. I felt in a great hurry
to have something done. It is true that I
knew at the time what I wanted to do, but
when I attempted to do it, I would either
find opposition by some one or a strange
inability to do what I wanted done. I did
not give up preaching until the 28th of
June. I shall never forget that day; it
was Sabbath; I preached in Kinderhook,
and, I think, had the Sacrament; it was a
day of great gloominess and trial.</p>

<p>The next day being Monday, my wife
took me to Hillsdale to see our friends,
hoping a change of place and scenery
would help me. But O, how restless I
was when I got there; I could not be persuaded
to stay any length of time; it seemed
as though I must go back; and when I got
home I was more wretched than ever. I
was sorry I went home. We visited the
parish the following week, but none knew
where we went; my feelings all seemed a
wreck. I did not feel sick during all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
time. I laid all my feelings at this time to
outward circumstances; I suffered them to
prey upon my mind. I had always kept
clear of all difficulties; was very tenacious
about my standing in society. But I thought
I now saw that I was liable to suffer as a
minister, and also in my moral character as
a Christian; and somehow my hands seemed
tied. If I resolved on any particular given
course, I seemed to have no power or ability
to carry it out. I ceased to write in my
diary about the middle of July. If I
attempted to write anything I could not
find words to say what I wanted to, and if
I wrote anything I was not satisfied with
it, and would tear it out; so I ceased to
write altogether.</p>

<p>About this time I took my room and
wished to be alone, and yet I wanted my
wife near me all the time, and wanted to
talk to her constantly upon the same subject.
I knew it was a great annoyance to
her, and yet it seemed to me that I could
not help it. I knew that I was wearing her
out by my course, yet I had no control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
over myself. It seemed to me that she
could help me out of all my troubles, at
least I acted so, and yet my judgment told
me she could not. I groaned much; my
appetite now entirely failed; I did not
want to eat for days. Sleep entirely left
me, and a night seemed an eternity. I prevailed
on my wife to take a separate room
to prevent my wearing her out with my
groanings. I felt now that I did not want
to eat, sleep, or drink anything; my flesh
seemed to dry down to my bones. It was
at this stage of my condition that I felt that
I was the worst being in the world. I
shall never forget that I thought Jeff. Davis
was a saint compared to me; yet I knew
all that passed; my mind was as clear to
reason as at this moment, but I viewed
everything in a most extravagant light.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, about the first of August,
that I lay on my bed; I think some of the
family were gone to church; I was in great
trouble of mind; all that I ever did that
was wrong seemed to rush upon my mind,
and though I did not have the consolations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of religion to comfort me, as I had been
accustomed to, yet I wanted to do all things
right, and leave nothing undone that I ought
to do. I felt that it was probable that I
should not live long, and I wanted to die.
At that moment, I thought of some nitrate
of silver and corrosive sublimate that I had
been using for certain purposes, that I had
set away rather carelessly, without labeling.
Fearing that some of the family might get
hold of them, mistaking them for medicine,
I sprung from the bed, took the bottle of
nitrate of silver, ran out door with it, made
a hole in the ground, and meant to empty
the contents of the bottle into this hole;
but all at once I thought that some animal
might get it and be killed by it. I hesitated,
ran back with the bottle, then resolved
again to bury it. The day was very hot,
and I was running about with this bottle
in my hand, undecided what to do with it.
At that moment my family came in; wanted
to know what I had. I told them; they
did not believe me, of course, for I had
never told them what was in this bottle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
they snatched it from my hand, and threw
it somewhere, I could not see where. I
thought I had as much trouble before as I
could bear, but this seemed worse than all
the rest put together; I imagined that some
animal or human being would get hold of
that nitrate of silver and be killed, and I
should be charged with their death.</p>

<p>The next day I brought out the corrosive
sublimate and meant to have buried it, but
my wife snatched it from me and threw it
into the cook stove; this, too, alarmed me,
fearing some one would be poisoned with
it, and even warned them all not to eat the
food cooked on the stove, lest they should
be poisoned. It will be seen that all these
things were evidences that my mind had
given way and that I was a prostrated
man; yet I knew all that passed.</p>

<p>Boils at this time came out on my face
and head; they were very painful; I have
no knowledge of ever suffering so much
pain before as I did with these boils. At
this time the rain fell in torrents, with much
thunder and lightning; it rained for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
days. This rendered the scene to me much
more gloomy and dismal.</p>

<p>My physician now gave me medicine,
and after a day or two I felt as well as I
ever did in my life; got up, my head feeling
clear; dressed and went into the garden,
and tried to work a little, but I was too
weak to do much; discouragement came
over me and I gave it up. Friends had
called during the last two weeks, but I
had refused to see them; I wanted to be
alone. From the middle of August until
the 19th, I was feeling much better, and
my appetite began to come; medicine had
had a good effect.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>On the 19th of August, my physician
with another came in, and I was called up
to see them; as I walked out, my physician
left the house, leaving the other to converse
with me. He commenced conversation; I
did not understand his object; my wife told
me to ask him about the nitrate of silver
and corrosive sublimate, and hear what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
doctor would say about it. I told him the
story as it was, and asked him if he thought
any damage could proceed from it. He said
no, he thought not; that it might kill the
grass, perhaps, where it was thrown, and
that would be all. I thought no more of
his call; he left, and I have never seen
them since. They went immediately to
Hudson, I understood, and got a warrant
from the judge to take me to the asylum
at Utica.</p>

<p>These doctors were Benson and Talmage;
their mission was now ended, and I suppose
they calculated they had done a great
good to their country. It is not a supposable
case that men who can coldly deprive
a man of his liberty when he is harmless,
would ever enquire after his welfare, or
send him a word of comfort; of course I
never expected it of these men, and I have
no doubt, if the truth could be known, that
they would have greatly preferred to have
had me die in the asylum than to have had
me live and come out again.</p>

<p>The next day, the 20th of August, 1863,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
about 9 o'clock in the morning, I was called
out of my room to dress and take a ride as
far as the depot. I rose, dressed and went
out. I perceived they seemed in a hurry;
I got into the wagon with three men besides
myself; these were George Harvey,
J. Snyder and Rev. A. Farr. As I got into
the wagon and saw my trunk, I enquired
where they were going. Mr. Harvey told
me I was going to the asylum in Utica.</p>

<p>I have always thought until this day
that those three men supposed that what I
said and did when I was told where I was
going, was a sudden outburst of insanity,
but I knew as well what I said, and what I
did, as they knew; yet I said some things
which I ought not to have said. I knew
that I was getting better fast; I knew that
I had had a terrible time of it; I had felt
much better for a few days past; my mind
was not as much agitated as it had been.
At a glance I took in the whole scene before
me. I saw that I had been deceived;
that I was torn from home without my
consent; was to be shut up with raving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
maniacs, and probably to die with them. I
saw how cold and unfeeling men could be
when a little power was given them; I felt
that the world and the church had turned
against me. I rose in the wagon in despair
and indignation; I said strong things;
I knew who had been the chief instruments
of my imprisonment. I begged to go anywhere
else rather than to Utica; when this
was denied me, and I was told by Mr.
Snyder to sit down, I announced that I
should consider myself no longer a member
of the Methodist E. Church; that my connection
was dissolved. This was an outburst,
it is true, and a foolish one, but I knew
what I said, and at the time I meant it. I
felt that I was forsaken by God and man;
I also confessed that I was a bad man,
given over by the Almighty, and had no
hope. This was the substance of the confession.
This was also wrong; even if it had
been true, no one could be benefited by
such a confession. I knew what I said
and I know too what reply was made by
Mr. Farr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>I know that these expressions of mine
were marks showing that my mind had
been racked. I could not control my mind
as usual; yet my memory and reasoning
powers were not broken; I ought not to
have been sent to an insane asylum.</p>

<p>My attendants soon found that there was
no need of fetters or handcuffs to get me to
Utica; so one after another fell off, leaving
me but with one man, and he not much of
a giant. When he told me that he had all
the papers in his pocket for my commitment,
I made up my mind to be a <i>law and
order man</i>, and I have never heard that he
had any trouble in getting his patient
within the bolts and bars of that <i>humane
institution</i>, as some are disposed to call it.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>
<p>We arrived there the same day, and I was
locked up in the third story of the building,
with about forty raving maniacs. Others
must judge of my feelings when I sat
down and looked around me and saw
where I was, among entire strangers, and
all these disfranchised like myself. One
of my first thoughts, after I arrived there,
was: &#8220;<i>Would to God that I were crazy</i>&#8212;so
crazy that I could not realize where I am,
or what I am, or what will be my future.&#8221;</p>

<p>But more of this in its appropriate place.
I now wish to appropriate a chapter to a
particular subject, viz.: to the manner in
which patients are sent to the asylum, and
the laws of the State of New York on that
subject.</p>

had been in the asylum, to show that it was no disgrace to
go there; that did not comfort me. He next called my
attention to the case of Major Lee, of Sandy Hill, who had
recently died, and to the disposition of his property. I
knew he did this to divert my mind; I was indifferent to
all this, as I knew what it was done for.</p></div></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>It must not be understood that the same
mode of operation is practiced in all cases
in sending patients to an insane or lunatic
asylum. It must be understood also that
we are speaking of a State institution, like
the one at Utica.</p>

<p>Some patients are supported in that
institution solely by the county to which
the patient belongs; others are supported
partly by the county and partly by the
friends of the patient, or by the patient
himself or herself, as the case may be;
while others, called private patients, are
supported wholly by themselves or by
their friends.</p>

<p>When a patient is entered as <i>private</i>, it
is not necessary to consult doctors, judges
or jurors. Suppose it to be a wife, a
husband, or a child. The patient is taken
to the asylum, terms of entrance are fixed
upon with the superintendent, bonds are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
given or money in advance as security, and
the patient is received. In the most of
cases the patient is not consulted in the
matter. In some cases, however, the patient
is consulted, and consents to go; is made
to believe that the asylum is like any other
infirmary or hospital, where patients are
taken to be nursed and cared for, and cured
if possible. In the most of cases, perhaps,
there is a kind of dread and horror attending
a patient taken to the asylum, and very
many go against their will. This opposition
is generally attributed to their insanity,
and is too generally received as evidence
that such an one is a fit subject for a lunatic
asylum. Should this dread and fear of
going to an asylum be made the criterion
by which to determine the sanity or insanity
of the patient, I have no doubt but more
than three-fourths of the people of the
State of New York would be adjudged
insane.</p>

<p>Another mode of getting a subject into
the asylum&#8212;the laws of the State having
fixed this mode&#8212;is as follows: Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
physicians are consulted, and if in their
judgment the subject is insane, they so
represent the case to the judge of the
county, and he issues his order to commit
this subject to the asylum, and the order is
obeyed. This mode of operation covers a
vast number of cases, ranging through all
the different grades of what physicians may
be pleased to call insanity, from acute mania
down through melancholia and epilepsy to
the dull, moping, driveling state of idiocy,
taking, in its sweep, dotage and childishness
of old age.</p>

<p>Here a grand field is opened for operation
for designing men and women and for
speculation. If the subject begins to be a
care and burden to the younger portion
of the family&#8212;if the subject shows some
marks of eccentricity&#8212;if the patient discovers
marks of dotage in the loss of
memory which causes frequent questions on
the same subject, and especially if a large
property lies between the subject and his
or her children or relatives&#8212;it is an easy
matter, in such cases, and very convenient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
to place such subjects in a place away
from excitement and care, where they will
be well used, and nursed as they could
not be at home, and at the same time the
family relieved of a great burden. The
matter is talked up; the good of the
patient is only held out to view; the real
cause and reasons for this change are
concealed. Doctors are consulted, and by
the kind and careful representations of the
friends of the patient, the doctors are easily
made to believe that the subject is no longer
fit to manage his or her affairs, and that
ease and quiet would greatly contribute to
their comfort&#8212;especially if they could be
removed away and out of sight of home
and their business&#8212;and so they come to the
conclusion that the lunatic asylum would be
the appropriate place for them; and so they
all come to the conclusion that it would be
best to try it for awhile at least. But to
make all safe, an order would be best from
the judge; then none could complain that
oppression had been practiced.</p>

<p>An order is easily obtained, as the patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
perhaps is not to be a county charge, but supported
out of his or her own money. I have
in my mind at this time a number of such
cases, with which I have been acquainted;
some of them are now in the asylum; others
have died there, as most if not all of this
class will do. And why should they not
die there? They are not placed there to
be cured of old age, nor their state of dotage,
nor of a suicidal or revengeful spirit.
These were not charged upon them, for
they were harmless as children; they were
placed there for the relief of other minds,
and to lessen the cares of those who owe
to them their lives and their tenderest
watch-care in their declining years! Will
such friends or relatives be anxious to know
how the old gentleman or lady fares, away
from home, locked up as in a prison, and
confined by iron grates and bolts? Do such
ones care whether their victim, who has
always had his liberty, be locked into a
cell at night alone, or whether he is locked
in with a half dozen of raving mad men?
Will such ones inquire whether he suffers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
with cold, or whether his food is suited to
his appetite, and such as he has been used
to at his own full board?</p>

<p>Could the beams of these prison houses
speak out, and could the stones cry out of
the walls of some of those upper back halls
in the asylum at Utica, the revelations of
the woes and sufferings of humanity would
so shock and astonish the outward world,
that instead of classing this institution with
the <i>humane</i> and <i>benevolent</i> institutions of the
country, it would be classed with those
ancient Bastilles which have furnished a history
of the most cruel and bloody tragedies
ever acted under the sun!</p>

<p>I never conceived or realized, until on my
way to Utica under keepers, on what a slender
thread hangs the liberty of the people
of the State of New York. Only the day
before, I was feeling that the spell that had
lain upon me for more than a month, was
broken; all things began to appear more
natural; my appetite became strong, though
I was weak in body; I looked haggard,
but I believed my system was thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
cleansed. I know now, and I knew then,
that I understood my own case better than
others. I only needed a word of encouragement
and comfort to set me all right,
instead of censure and cold neglect.</p>

<p>My words of self-reproach, and confession
of moral delinquency, had been taken
advantage of, to charge me with crimes of
which I was never guilty. It is true that
I felt that I was a great sinner in general;
that I never had done anything as I ought
to have done it; yet when asked to define
what I meant, and name the particulars in
which my great sins consisted, I recollect
how dumb and vacant my mind would be,
and wondered why I could not frame an
answer to their questions.</p>

<p>It finally resolved itself into this, that I
had done just nothing at all, all my days,
and yet had been supported by the people
for doing nothing, and that for this I should
be damned.</p>

<p>Yet, I say, that all these thoughts were
giving way to a more calm and steady state
of mind, instead of that fear and haste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
which had haunted me for more than a
month; I began to be more indifferent also
to outward circumstances.</p>

<p>Being in my own house, I thought I
could act out my feelings without fear of
consequences. I never once thought of the
danger of getting into the asylum. I had
never thought such a thing possible, for I
knew that insanity was never known in one
of my family. Could I have had one hint
that my restlessness was leading to this, I
think I could have prevented it, and should
have done so.</p>

<p>But I wish here to enter my protest
against the manner that thousands are
rushed into the asylum, by those who have
no knowledge of asylum life and but little
if any knowledge of the philosophy of the
human mind. Many have been sent there
who had been ill but a few days, and were
soon over it, and could they have been left
at home a week longer, all would have
been right; whereas, by being sent to the
asylum, they have been kept there confined
for two years&#8212;for when once in the asylum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
it is no easy matter to get away in a short
time, unless they run away.</p>

<p>I know men in the asylum who were
thrown in there by their friends, under
some peculiar influence, who have been
there from six to fifteen years; and they
are the same now as when they entered it,
not insane, but perhaps a little eccentric, or
may entertain some notions on religion or
philosophy that are not regarded orthodox.
They are in good health, perfectly harmless,
and, so far as I could judge, would make
better inhabitants than one-fourth of the
people that are at large.</p>

<p>The question now arises&#8212;&#8220;What would
you have done to remedy the evil of putting
men and women in the asylum that should
never go there?&#8221; My answer is, that I
would so change the laws that two inexperienced
quack doctors could not govern the
destinies of the people of a whole county.
I would first require that those men who
are to decide on the fate of their neighbors
should be men of experience and discretion,
and that there should be at least five of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
them in a county, chosen by the people for
that purpose; I would also require that the
patient be brought before a jury of twelve
men, who shall decide the matter after the
five doctors have examined the patient and
given their opinions.</p>

<p>I would require that those five doctors
should make themselves acquainted with
asylum life; I speak now of State asylums,
not private ones. I would have them know
how patients are treated, as to medicine,
diet, &amp;c. For how can a jury or doctors
recommend and decide that the asylum is
the proper place for the patient, when they
know nothing of its character, only that it
is called a State Lunatic Asylum?</p>

<p>I would annihilate that argument so often
used to induce the ignorant and the innocent
to become willing to go to that den of death!
The argument is, that many great and noted
men have been inmates of the asylum, such
as Gerrit Smith, Esquire W., General B. and
Judge C. This was the argument used on
me while on my way to the prison. I would
go still further. I would require that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
managers of such an institution should not
leave to one man the destinies of so many
hundreds of souls; that they should be
required to see for themselves all the
internal workings of the institution, that its
evils may not become chronic and incurable.
I would also require that patients be treated
as men and women, and not as dumb beasts,
in the manner of doctoring them; that the
doctors should conform to the same rules
that they would out of the institution in
doctoring free agents. That is to say, that,
when a patient is cured of a certain disease
for which medicine is given, the medicine
so given shall be taken off or stopped,
and not continued for weeks and months
after the end is gained for which the
medicine is given. To illustrate what I
mean: The doctor orders a certain kind of
medicine to a patient; it is a strong tonic,
for instance, to give strength and an appetite;
the patient takes it three times a day for
three months; at the end of three months
the patient finds himself well, with a strong
appetite, and works hard every day. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
patient now says to the doctor, that he feels
well, has a good appetite, and thinks the
medicine had better be taken off, as it
begins to act too heavily upon the system.
The doctor replies, &#8220;that the medicine must
not be taken off; that he must take it as
long as he lives, and ask no questions.&#8221;
Would any one, out of such an institution,
employ such a physician? Now we all
know that anywhere but in a lunatic asylum,
medicine is not given except in cases of
necessity, and when the object is gained for
which the medicine is given, the medicine is
taken off or withheld. Is this so in the
asylum? Every man in that institution,
who is sane enough to know the current
events of the asylum, knows this is not so.
I am a witness, with hundreds besides me,
that medicine once ordered will be continued
three times a day for two years, without
interruption, and no questions asked the
patient by the doctors about the effect of
that medicine. I know it was so in my
case, and no argument or remonstrance
could induce the doctor to even change the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
medicine. I shall have occasion to say
more on this subject in another place. I
would have this matter regulated.</p>

<p>I have not a doubt, that if all these
matters were fully and rightly investigated
and controlled, a much smaller number
would be sent to the asylum, and those
who were sent would have less reason to
complain. I do not mean that that institution
or any other could be so conducted
that none would complain of ill treatment;
this perhaps would be impossible; but it
could be so conducted that there would be
far less suffering there than now exists.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>I will now return to the narrative of my
two years in the asylum. I never can forget
my feelings when I got out of the carriage
and walked up the stone steps and
into the centre of that mammoth building.
The very thought that I was brought to a
lunatic asylum, as a patient, was sufficient
to take all the man out of me. I glanced
my eyes around upon the massive walls,
and high ceilings, and sat down. The
doctor came, and my case was introduced
to him by my attendant; a very few
words passed between the doctor and me;
I begged to not be left; I knew not what
was before me; I had not formed the least
idea of the construction of the building, nor
of the manner in which patients were
managed.</p>

<p>My attendant, Mr. Harvey, gave me over
into the hands of Dr. Gray, the superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of the asylum, and seemed to be in
haste to get out of my sight; at least it
seemed so to me. I asked him how long
he was going to leave me here; he replied
&#8220;perhaps about two months; when your
folks get settled they will send for you.&#8221; But
instead of coming to take me away in two
months, it was ten months before I heard
one word from any person I had ever
known before I went to that place, though
I often enquired. I finally came to the
conclusion that my wife must be dead, or I
should have heard from her.</p>

<p>The first intimation I received concerning
any of my family, was a visit from my
daughter from Illinois, ten months after I
entered the institution; this to me was as
a visit from an angel from Heaven.</p>

<p>But to return to the thread of my narrative.
I said but little to the doctor; my
spirits were crushed, and I doubt not but I
showed it; I was worn to a skeleton; I
was well dressed, excepting one thing, and
that was invisible. In my haste in the
morning in dressing I left off my suspenders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
as I was urged to hurry, and supposed
I was only going to take a short ride. I
observed this when I got to Utica, and got
out of the cars; and having left my porte-monnaie
at home with my watch, I had no
money to purchase a pair. So I ventured
to state the fact to the man that accompanied
me to Utica, and asked him to buy
me a pair; he looked blank and cold towards
me, as though he thought I did not
know what I asked for, and made me no
reply. I felt grieved; I never doubted
but he thought it was a freak of madness
that caused me to ask for the suspenders.
I thought I would not repeat my request,
but often thought that at some subsequent
time I would show him that I knew what I
asked for, and tell him how I felt when he
treated the matter so coldly; but I have
never mentioned the subject to him since,
and should not have mentioned it now, only
to show, that no incident happened at that
time, however small, but is still fresh in my
recollection.</p>

<p>I bade my friend who took me there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
good bye, with a heavy heart, and the doctor
ordered me taken on to the third hall,
which was the third story of the building
from the ground floor. There I found
about forty patients, the majority of which
were very insane. I was afraid as I entered
the room; I took a seat on a row of benches
fastened to the floor. I have already stated
that I at this period wished myself as
insane as the rest; I then should not be
afraid. I saw that they were reckless,
raving, and knocking each other. I looked
round among the patients to see if I could
see any that looked intelligent and sane;
I saw a little old white-headed man that
looked the most like a sane man of any on
the hall. I approached him and spoke to
him; I found his name was Francis; a
brother of the editor of the Troy Times;
he has since died in the asylum.</p>

<p>A small incident took place a few minutes
after I entered the hall, that, though small
in itself, was nevertheless most annihilating
to my feelings. Mr. Jones, one of the
attendants of the hall, approached me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
said he must search my pockets. So he
went into all my pockets, and as good luck
would have it, he found nothing but a few
pennies; these he said he must take. I
said, &#8220;very well, take them.&#8221; He never
mentioned it afterwards to me. I have
never doubted but many things are taken
from the patients in that way that they
never get again. I regard it no less a
crime than highway robbery, only more
low and cowardly.</p>

<p>It must be understood that the patient's
word is not received in evidence if it is contradicted
by the attendant. An attendant
might take anything from a patient, and if
complaint should be made by the patient
to the superintendent, the attendant has
only to deny it, and then woe to that patient,
if the attendant pleases to chastise him.</p>

<p>Patients had better suffer than to reveal
anything against an attendant, for suffer
he will if he does reveal it to the doctor.
I shall, perhaps, have occasion to speak of
this hereafter, in relation to the loss of my
clothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>I will here state that as the doctors have
a name for every degree and kind of mental
derangement, mine was termed by them
<i>melancholy</i>&#8212;a state of gloominess that
some would term hypochondria. I believe
none ever charged me with being wild and
incoherent in my expressions, and though
it is proverbial in the institution, among
the patients and attendants, that if a man
says he is not insane it is a sure sign that
he is, so in consequence of this saying, I
was careful to say nothing about my own
mental condition, only to ask the attendants
and doctors, at times, whether they observed
marks of insanity in me.</p>

<p>I once asked one of the doctors this
question, and he said he did see marks of
insanity in me. I expected this answer, for
we were disagreeing about the manner in
which they were doctoring me. So he gave
me to understand that his word was law,
and whatever I thought or whatever I said
would make no difference; that I must obey
his directions, and would often lay his hand
on his mouth, thereby indicating to me that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
I must not speak unless I was spoken to.
I pitied the doctor more than I blamed him,
for I saw in him positive and decided marks
of tyranny that were in his organization: A
dark countenance, low built, short neck, a
low forehead, not broad, and eyebrows nearly
or quite meeting; a peculiar side glance of
his eyes, as though he was looking wondrously
wise at times; was subject to a
low criticism of words; nothing noble and
manly about him.</p>

<p>These remarks may seem to the reader
not only too severe but uncalled for. I do
not doubt but it does so appear, but I cannot
help it; and I confess there was nothing I
dreaded so much as to see this doctor come
on the hall, and it was always a relief to
me when he left.</p>

<p>But to return to my first day's experience
in the asylum. In two or three hours,
supper was announced by the ringing of a
bell; all rushed to the end of the hall, and
through a doorway into the dining room,
where two long tables were set that would
seat forty boarders. I was seated between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
two very insane men&#8212;one an Irishman and
the other I think a German. The victuals
were all on the plates when we sat down,
and the tea, or whatever the drink might
be called, was already prepared in large
pitchers, and poured out in small punch
bowls, which were used as a substitute for
tea cups and saucers. This was a kind of
tea, very weak, prepared with milk and
sugar before being turned into the bowls.
I tasted it, but it being so different from
what I had been used to drinking, as I had
never used sugar in my tea, it produced a
most sickening influence.</p>

<p>The supper consisted of a couple of
pieces of bread, one of wheat, and the
other what they called brown or Graham
bread&#8212;the best I thought I ever had
seen&#8212;a small piece of butter and a small
square piece of gingerbread. As I sat
nibbling a little, for I did not eat much
the first meal, my Irish companion on
the right reached to my plate and took my
bread. I looked at him, but he did not
notice me; next he reached and took my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
butter, not seeming to act as though he had
done anything out of order. An Irishman
on the opposite side of the table reached
and took the remainder of my bread and
cake, so that when supper was ended, it
appeared that I had eaten very heartily,
for when I sat down there was enough on
my plate to satisfy any hungry man. It
was astonishing to see with what rapidity
some of those lunatics would devour their
food.</p>

<p>When supper was over, one of the
attendants came round to every man's
plate, took up the knives and counted
them, to see if any were missing. This
was done to prevent any evil from those
who might be suicidal or otherwise evil
disposed. At a given signal, all arose and
went out. I observed, however, that a
number of patients staid in the dining
room to help in clearing off the table,
washing up, and setting the table again for
breakfast.</p>

<p>As soon as this was ended, I heard a sound
ringing through the whole length of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
hall, &#8220;<i>Bed time gents</i>.&#8221; I thought it very
strange, as the sun was yet an hour high.
The attendant came to me and told me I
must retire. I said, &#8220;this is earlier than
I am used to retiring.&#8221; He made no reply,
but led me into a large dormitory, at the
end of the hall, containing five beds. One
of these was assigned to me; the others
were occupied by two Irishmen, and two
Americans&#8212;one from Saratoga Springs, by
the name of Burnham, the other from Hartford,
N.Y., whose name I do not now recollect.
Burnham and one of the Irishmen
were very crazy. The Irishman would get
out of bed, wrap himself in his sheet, walk
the room, or stand and look out the window,
keeping up, in the meantime, an incoherent
jingle of words, mixing it with
cursings on all Protestants, threatening to
scald them to death with hot water; while
Burnham would damn him and pour upon
him the most bitter curses.</p>

<p>I tried to appease them by flattery. So
the night wore away, and in consequence
of the novelty of the scene, being locked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
up in a room with four crazy men, our
clothing left out in the hall, the quarreling
of my room-mates, with now and then a
wild yell from some other apartment, were
not very favorable accompaniments to sleep
or rest. Sleep entirely departed; I did
not feel the least sensation of sleep during
the whole night.</p>

<p>No one, unless placed in the same condition
with myself, can imagine with what
pain and anguish I passed that first night
of my captivity. I had already seen that
patients were treated more like prisoners
than like innocent men and invalids. I had
been in bed about an hour, it being now
about sundown, when one of the attendants,
a gladiatorial looking German, entered the
dormitory bearing in his hand a tray of
medicine, arranged in rows in little white
earthen mugs, each holding perhaps a half
of a gill; he came to my bed side and held
out one of these mugs to me, and said in
broken English, &#8220;<i>trink tis</i>.&#8221; I had seen
enough already to know that resistance or
remonstrance was of no use, so drank the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
nostrum but a more nauseous dose I never
took. In half an hour more another dose
was presented of another kind, I knew not
what. I began to think by this time that
if a man could live through all this, he
must be made of stern stuff.</p>

<p>The morning came, and I was glad to see
the light and to get out of that inner prison,
where I could have a little wider liberty
in walking the hall, which was about two
hundred feet long by ten or twelve feet
wide, with bed-rooms ranged on each side.
After adjusting matters in my sleeping
room, making beds and sweeping&#8212;as every
patient is expected to make his or her own
bed, unless unable to do so by physical or
mental inability&#8212;I was introduced to a
wash room. In this room there were barely
accommodations to wash by forty patients
washing out of about two tin wash dishes,
one after another, till all had finished, and
then all wipe on about two towels hanging
on the wall. No looking glass, combs or
brushes were furnished for patients on this
hall. I did not see my face in a glass until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
I left that hall and went to another, which
was six weeks from the time I entered the
asylum.</p>

<p>Breakfast was announced by the same
ringing of the bell. The men were soon
in their places; I lingered a little, and
was urged forward. I was no sooner in
my old place by the side of my agreeable
companions, than the Irishman on my right
snatched at my bread on my plate; I turned
his arm aside, but he seemed determined to
seize the whole contents of my plate, which
consisted of bread, potato, a piece of cold
baked beef and a small piece of butter.
Instead of tea, it was called coffee, prepared
in the same manner of the tea. I could not
drink it at first, but finally by degrees
worked myself up to the point. A most
wonderful drink is this for sick folks!</p>

<p>As to the diet, so far as I was concerned,
all was well enough; they make use of a
vast amount of meat; and it was amusing
to hear Dr. Gray philosophise on the utility
of the patients eating so much meat. This,
perhaps, was all well enough, but in no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
place but in a lunatic asylum would such
doctrines be urged, expecting the people
would indorse them, as a diet for invalids,
and especially for invalids whose disease is
supposed to be mostly of the mind. It is
generally supposed, by reasoning beings,
that less meat and more variety in lighter
food, would be more appropriate to such
constitutions as the asylum is made up of.
But concerning this matter, I must give no
decided opinion; I consider it of minor
importance, compared with other things.</p>

<p>The second day had now come; it was
Friday, the 21st day of August. I took
the medicine in the morning, and after
breakfast set myself to learning all I could
of the institution by observation. I noticed
that in some of the rooms were cribs in
which were confined patients by a lid or
cover, locked down; these I regarded as
men who were not safe to have their liberty
and to lie on ordinary beds, and I found
this was so. I noticed also that food was
carried to these, of a very light nature, as
farina or a little soup, and sometimes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
small piece of toast. I wondered how
men could live on so very little as they
seemed to give them, but perhaps they had
all that was necessary.</p>

<p>I noticed one among these, of a manly
and noble bearing, when he would rise out
of his crib; and on inquiry, I found his
name to be Maulby, Doctor Maulby, who
had been in the institution for many years;
and before I left the institution he died
there. He was a man, I was informed, of
superior talents, and at times was very
insane.</p>

<p>In one end of this hall, I observed a large
wardrobe or closet, in which all the clothing
of the patients was kept for this hall. No
patient on this hall is allowed to keep his
clothing in his own room; and indeed this
is the case with every other hall in the
building, except the first hall, which is
used mostly for cured patients and the
convalescent.</p>

<p>On the gentlemen's side of the house,
there are about twelve halls occupied by
patients, making in all about three hundred;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and as many on the opposite side of the
building occupied by females, averaging in
all, perhaps, as a general thing, about six
hundred.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock in the morning of this
my second day in the asylum, I observed a
rush of all the patients around a large
basket which had been brought out, containing
their hats and caps. It was the
hour of going out to walk and take the air
in the yard, an enclosure attached to the
building, of two or three acres, guarded on
two sides by the building and on the other
two by a high board fence. This yard was
beautifully laid out in walks, and covered
with grass, trees, and shrubbery.</p>

<p>I supposed I must go out with the rest
of the lunatics, so I walked up to take my
hat, but I was told I could not go. I could
not see the point at that time, but afterwards
learned that no patients, when they first
come, are allowed to go out until they
have been there a number of days. I was
glad of this, for I preferred staying in
alone to going out with that motley group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of maniacs. Not only from this hall did
patients go into this yard, but from all the
halls, except the first, second and fourth,
and sometimes they went from these; and
when all these came together, it furnished
a most interesting yet ludicrous picture&#8212;all
the nations of the earth here represented,
making a perfect bedlam.</p>

<p>I spent the forenoon as best I could,
walking up and down the hall, and sitting
alone in my glory; all seemed a blank.
In the course of the forenoon Dr. C., who
had charge of the north wards of the building,
which contained the men's side, came
on the hall. He introduced himself to me
as the physician of this ward, and took some
pains to impress me with the idea that
&#8220;<i>he was the boss of this shanty</i>,&#8221; and that
his orders must be carried out to the letter.
This doctor had charge of the men under
Dr. Gray, while Dr. Kellogg had charge of
the female department.</p>

<p>This first interview with the doctor made
an unfavorable impression upon my mind.
I next came to a point in my experience in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the institution which added greatly to my
fears, and filled me with anguish, and robbed
me of all confidence in the attendants,
that they had any regard whatever for the
feelings and comfort of the patients.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of Friday, my second
day in the asylum, I was told by the little
Dutchman, the second attendant, to go with
him; I followed; he went into the bath-room,
carrying a change of my clean underclothes,
which they had taken from my
trunk; when in the bath-room he locked
the door; there stood the bath, about two-thirds
full of water, or rather mud and
slime, in which ten or twelve filthy maniacs
had been scrubbed and washed with soft
soap, until the water had become quite
thick and disgusting to look upon. He said
to me in his broken English, &#8220;<i>untress
you and kit in dare</i>.&#8221; I looked at him
and said, &#8220;am I to bathe in that mud and
slush?&#8221; he said, &#8220;yes, kit in dare quick.&#8221;
I saw I was sold; I was weak in body, the
door locked, and though when in my full
strength could have thrown him into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
bath and held him there; yet now I doubted
my ability to vie with him, and besides, I
knew he had the power to call to his aid
whoever he chose. I did not deliberate
long; I threw off my clothes and jumped
in, but jumped out as soon as I went in,
and called for a towel to wipe off the filth;
he refused to give me one, but ordered me
to take my cast-off shirt and wipe myself
with it. I did so as well as I could, and
begged for a clean pail of water to wash
myself with, but this was refused.</p>

<p>I made complaint to the first attendant
on the hall, but got no satisfaction. I saw
the matter was all understood between
them; it was done to save time and a little
work. There was water plenty, so that
each and every man could have had a clean
bath; if not, it were far better to not bathe
at all, than to bathe in a mud hole. But
the laws must be obeyed to make each and
every patient bathe once a week. I knew
if I complained to the doctor, it would be
no better, for he would either justify the
course, or the attendants would deny that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
such an event ever took place, and I alone
would be the sufferer.</p>

<p>I did, however, before I left the institution,
lay this matter, with some other things,
before Dr. S., a fine humane man who was in
the institution for a year before I left. He
believed my story and reprobated the
course. I only wished at the time that
those who forced me into such measures
had been obliged to bathe in the same
slough hole.</p>

<p>Such attendants are men that never went
in good society. I can say as Job said of
those who taunted him in his affliction, that
they were men that he, before he was cast
down, would not have associated with his
dogs; yet, now they ridiculed him when
he was in trouble. So say I; these are
men that now, and before I went to the
asylum, I should have been ashamed to
associate with, but having a little power,
they humbled me, and in fear I obeyed
them, yet I despised them, and I cannot
forget them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p>The first Sabbath came the 23d of August.
I had seen nothing of the institution as yet,
only what I had seen from this hall. I
could only look out of a north window,
and see the hills afar off, the valley of the
Mohawk stretching east and west as far as
the eye could reach; could see the cars
passing up and down the valley, and the
canal, with its loaded crafts slowly but
constantly passing by. I could also see
fine carriages constantly passing by, going
in and out of the city. I could also see
the beautiful lawn lying at my feet, and
stretching away to the street passing out of
the city. While I stood at my window
and saw all this, and then turned and
looked at myself, shut up and confined
with bars and bolts, I then began to think
that I could now conceive how those poor
creatures felt whom I had often seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
crowding to prison windows to catch a
glimpse of passers-by, through their iron
grates.</p>

<p>I recollect, while thus employed and thus
philosophising, of crying out, that &#8220;<i>my life
is a failure</i>.&#8221; I had never realized before
the sweets of liberty, and finally came
almost to the conclusion that I must have
committed some crime, or I never should
have been thus confined and shut out from
society; yet I had no knowledge that I had
violated the law in any sense.</p>

<p>Yes, this was a lonely Sabbath; yet I felt
that while I remained in that institution, I
had no desire to go out or to form any
acquaintances. I could not get rid of the
idea that the whole process of proceedings
in putting me into the asylum was deception
from end to end. First, they were deceived
as to the cause of my trouble; secondly,
they were deceived in regard to my real
condition. I did not wish to look any man
in the face, outside of the asylum, for the
reason that I supposed all within its walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
were regarded as insane and unfit to mingle
in society.</p>

<p>I learned that there was service in the
chapel that evening, but nothing was said
to me about attending; and I did not
mention it, for fear I should be denied the
privilege of attending.</p>

<p>A day or two more passed away, and I
had not, as yet, put off my best clothes.
I was thinking of it, and then I thought
again&#8212;&#8220;Why should I care about the
future? And if I lay off this suit I shall
never see it again.&#8221; These were thoughts
that came into my mind; and I thought I
might as well wear out my best clothes as
to let others have them.</p>

<p>While these thoughts were revolving in
my mind, Mr. Jones, the attendant, came
to me and said&#8212;&#8220;You had better lay off
that suit of clothes, and put on a poorer
one, to wallow on the hall in.&#8221; So I made
the change, as I had a number of poorer
suits in my trunk. This suit that I laid off
was a very fine one and valuable. Time
went on, and in about six weeks I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
removed to the fourth floor. This was a
short hall on the first floor, extending west
from the main building; but the same suit
of clothes that I laid off, a few days after I
entered the asylum, I never saw again. I
was never fully satisfied what became of
them.</p>

<p>The State Fair was held in Utica that
fall, and I was invited to ride on to the
grounds, with others, in an omnibus. I did
not care to go, yet I did not think it best
to refuse; I consented and called for my
coat; a coat was brought me, but it was not
mine; it was much smaller, shorter sleeves,
and much worn; it was not worth ten dollars;
mine was worth thirty.</p>

<p>I made this known, but all the satisfaction
I got was to be told that I was mistaken.
I soon called for my pants and
vest which belonged to that coat, and was
told by the attendant on that hall, that I
never had such a pair of pants and vest as
I described&#8212;a fine pair of doeskins, and a
satin vest; and he told me if I persisted in
it, he would report me to higher authority;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
he even threatened me. I knew I was
right, yet I became afraid of my safety, as
this attendant on the fourth hall was an
old Irishman who had been a sailor, whose
principles were very bad; he was not a
man of truth or honesty; so I was obliged
to let the matter drop. I once thought of
stating the matter to Dr. Gray, but the
attendants put on their veto, and I let it
rest, but have never doubted but this same
old Irishman had my vest, for I am sure I
saw him wear it. As to the pants, I never
saw them again. I know I am not mistaken
about the coat, vest and pants; I got an old
coat in its stead which I still keep to show.</p>

<p>Cold weather soon came on, and I was
thinly clad. I missed my thick pants, and
though I had a good shawl, which I kept
my eye upon, yet I had no overcoat. I
one day said to the supervisor that I wished
I had my overcoats from home; that I had
two at home&#8212;one new and a very fine one,
the other a coarse one, but a good coat for
common wear.</p>

<p>A very few days after this my coats both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
came; I knew them well, by special marks.
The best one was taken and put away; the
other I was allowed to keep in my room to
throw on when we went out in the field.
It was not long before I called for my best
overcoat, as I was going to walk out. A
coat was brought me, but on examination,
I found it was not my coat; it was much
smaller, cut in a different fashion; was not
the same kind of cloth; yet it was a black
coat, and had a velvet collar like mine;
mine was worth at that time fifty dollars;
this was not worth twenty. I have never
worn the coat much since. I got me a new
one and keep this also to exhibit, to show
that I am not mistaken about the clothing.</p>

<p>My hat was also changed for one much
poorer; this might have been done by accident.
A new black silk cravat was taken,
and an old one given me in its stead. Now
all these things might have been done
through mistake, and not by design, yet, I
have never doubted but all was done by
design; knowing the attendants, I am
obliged to come to this conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be observed that, for the sake of
giving a history of my lost clothing, the
reader was brought down from the third to
the fourth floor; as I had not proceeded
through an entire week with my history of
that hall, we will now return to that
narrative. I had been there about a week
when I was permitted to go out in the
yard with the patients; and in walking in
the yard, I soon became acquainted with
men from other halls, with whom I could
converse, and I found, on comparison, that
those on the third were not as sane as many
from other halls; indeed, there were none
on that hall that could converse rationally
for any length of time; yet I did not desire
to change my place by being removed to
another floor. After being there about
a month, however, the doctor hinted to
me that I was to be removed to some
other floor. This I somehow dreaded, not
knowing where I was to be sent, and not
knowing the difference between one hall
and another; I begged to stay where I was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
choosing the sufferings I then had, to those
I knew not of.</p>

<p>After being there about two weeks, I one
day said to the attendant, that I wished him
to understand that if my plate was always
found emptied of its contents, at the close
of every meal, it was not because I had
eaten it all. I then told him it was very
annoying to me to have men snatching my
food from my plate every chance they could
get, and that I was obliged to guard my
plate in order to get enough to eat, and
the moment I finished, my plate was
immediately swept clean of all it contained.
He said I should sit there no
longer; so he removed me to the table
where he sat, and placed me by his side,
and I sat there until removed to another
hall.</p>

<p>As I have said, I was on this third hall
about six weeks. I have noticed but few
incidents connected with this hall, not
because I could not, but because I wish to
make my narrative as short as possible.
Should I record all the thrilling and ludicrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
incidents which happened upon this
hall, and others during my stay there, they
would fill an octavo of a thousand pages.
My object is not to give a history of the
institution, but simply my own narrative,
noticing, perhaps, now and then, a circumstance
which may fall in my way concerning
other patients; and while I am on this
subject, I will simply say, that I made the
acquaintance of a number of gentlemen in
that institution whose names I remember
with pleasure, and should perhaps make
mention of them if I thought it would be
pleasing to them, but knowing the delicacy
of such a subject, I shall forbear making
mention of any except those who I know
cannot be affected by it.</p>

<p>I was now placed upon the fourth hall,
and assigned to a room containing three
beds; this was about the first of October.
The inmates of this room were more
agreeable than on the third floor, though
one of them, at times, was very annoying.
He would be up and down all night;
would disarrange all the clothes of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
bed; would scold and worry, and complain
of ill treatment, if any one attempted to
assist him; until at length he was removed
on to some other hall and died there.</p>

<p>From this hall I was suffered to walk
out with other patients, guarded by attendants.
We would sometimes walk a mile
through the back fields attached to the
institution. I shall never forget that the
first day I entered this hall, I saw, walking
the hall, a delicate, well dressed, fine
looking gentleman, of middle age and very
long beard. There seemed to be an air of
aristocracy about him that attracted my
attention, and led me to inquire who he
was. I found he was from Albany; that
his name was Root; they called him Colonel
Root. He had done business in Albany;
married there into a good family and rich.
He lived rather too fast to suit his friends,
in traveling through Europe and America,
and drinking wine and brandy, so they
threw him into the asylum. No one could
detect in him any marks of insanity; but
the way he would curse his friends for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
running him into that institution, was a
caution. He was not the most gentle and
docile patient to manage in the whole
institution. Being a private patient, he had
what is called his extras in food. He was
often changed from one hall to another,
until, running down rapidly in health, he
died on the sixth hall, long before I left
the institution.</p>

<p>I liked the fare better on this hall than
on the third; it was a short hall, containing
about twenty patients. I soon discovered
that on this hall were a good many invalids;
I have seen as many as ten confined to their
beds on this hall at once; I regarded it a
kind of hospital. There was a hospital
attached to the institution, but I found, of
late, it had not been used much for that
purpose; that the sick were allowed to
remain on the halls with the well. This I
regarded an improvement.</p>

<p>At this time, frequent changes were made
on the halls in attendants; it was war time,
and young men were called into the field;
I suppose they had to take such as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
could get. A young man came on to the
fourth hall, as first attendant, soon after I
entered it, by the name of John Subert; a
young man of a good deal of self-conceit;
was very ignorant withal, and evidently
felt that he was highly promoted in having
a kind of charge over a few poor inmates
of a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>Doctor Gray is the sole superintendent
of the asylum. He has generally three
physicians under him, who watch over the
wants of the patients, and prescribe for
them. Next comes a supervisor, who takes
the general charge of four or five halls,
and is at the same time an attendant on one
of these four or five. This John Subert
was an attendant on the fourth hall, under
a supervisor; he was, in fact, nothing more
nor less than a servant waiter; yet he
sometimes assumed a good deal of authority.
He at one time called me to come and sit
down by his side, and began to talk to me
very gravely, and told me whenever I got
into any trouble and wanted anything, to
come to him and he would give me good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
advice. This, certainly, would have been
very kind, had it come from Doctor Gray
or even from a supervisor; but coming from
a waiter, and a young man not much over
twenty, and one so ignorant that he could
not converse intelligently five minutes on
any subject, and withal very wicked, using
much profane language, the idea of his
giving me good advice was most ludicrous.</p>

<p>I once asked this young gentleman for a
coverlid, as the weather was getting cold.
He brought me an old straw bed tick, very
dirty. I looked at it and then at him, and
asked him what he meant, to offer me that
dirty bed tick for a covering. I saw he
was mad. He said I was the damnedest
man he ever saw; would sew me up in the
tick. He then asked me if he should knock
me down. I told him yes, if he pleased.
He said he thought he would not begin
with me, as he had never knocked a man
down. I have never doubted but it was
best that he did not knock me down, or
attempt it, for I had regained my strength
at that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>And here I am happy to say that during
the two years and four months that I was
in the institution, I never received a blow
from attendant or patient, while many were
knocked headlong by both patients and
attendants. I was always on the watch to
keep out of the way of danger, and when I
found an ill-natured patient, or an ill-natured
attendant, had as little to say to
them as possible.</p>

<p>It is true, that there are times that a man
will pass through scenes that will stir his
blood, that perhaps he would not let pass
unnoticed out of that place; yet, I found
the best way to get along, was to bear all
things with a kind of stoicism.</p>

<p>I can never forget a small circumstance
which happened on this hall. After I had
eaten all that I desired, John Subert presented
me with a bowl of soup which he
had left. I hesitated; told him that I did
not need it. He said I should eat it; to
save trouble I ate what I could, and stopped;
he ordered me to eat the rest, and said I
should eat it. I was in a strait; I felt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
I could not swallow another spoonful; he
threatened; I ate a spoonful or two and
stopped; found it impossible to swallow any
more. At this point I felt unmanned; I
groaned bitterly; I felt that I had rather
die than be governed by such a gladiator.
I knew he did it only to show his authority.
I never knew why he took such a
course with me. Had I refused to eat my
regular meals, as some did refuse, and had
shown a suicidal spirit to starve myself, as
some did, then the case would have been
altered, and the attendant would have been
justified in forcing me to eat. But I was
well and hearty; my appetite was craving,
caused by the medicine forced down me
daily, and I found that I generally ate more
than was for my good; yet I did not eat
more than other patients; it was thought I
did not generally eat as much.</p>

<p>At another time, they had molasses and
some kind of pudding as a dessert. I ate
all I wanted and moved back; he had ate
and left a quantity of molasses and pudding;
he moved it before me and ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
me to eat it; molasses I never eat unless
obliged to; I tried to beg off, but he was
inflexible; I considered the matter and
complied; I thought it better to eat his
leavings than to have war at the table. I
considered that he was a low-bred wretch,
and a man of no principle. I have often
wondered if he would not like to see me
now, and talk up these matters, and show
me that it would be best for me to ask his
advice, and to eat his leavings. I have no
doubt but he would deny that these things
ever happened. I would deny them if I
were him. This is the way such men get
out from such charges. They have been in
the habit of abusing patients, and when
charged with the wrong, deny it to the
doctor, charging it to the insanity of the
patient. Many other small matters in themselves
might be related that will be passed
over, which would be very trying to a man
of good breeding.</p>

<p>When the patients of that institution can
be used as patients should be, and not as
criminals, prisoners or slaves, then, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
till then, will it become a blessing to the
State of New York instead of a curse.</p>

<p>I remained on the fourth hall until about
the first of December, when I was removed
to the first hall. I begged with all my
skill to stay on the fourth hall through the
winter, but all was in vain. The reasons
why I wanted to stay on the fourth hall
were, that it was warmer, and I did not
wish to become a gazing stock for the multitude
of visitors who daily flocked to the
asylum, take a walk through the first hall,
gaze on the patients as they would look
upon wild animals in a managerie, and then
depart. I found the arrangement on the
fourth hall for bathing as it should be;
each man had his bath by himself of clean
water. This became a luxury rather than a
dread, as upon the third floor. It is, however,
due to Mr. Jones, the attendant on
the third, to say that after two or three of
the first baths I took there, he gave me
clean water, and always used me like a
gentleman. The little Dutchman who gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
me my first bath, seemed to shun me after
I had learned the ropes a little better.</p>

<p>My medicine was kept up while on the
third and fourth halls without interruption
three times a day, always just before eating;
and soon after I came to the fourth hall,
another dose was added. This was some
kind of spirits; whether it was brandy or
some other kind of liquor I do not know;
one thing I do know, that it would fly into
my head, my face would feel hot and would
be as red as fire; it alarmed me at first, and
I begged to have it taken off, but it was of
no use; perhaps I was foolish in thinking
that they meant to make me drunk.</p>

<p>After a week or two this beverage was
taken off, and strong beer or porter was
substituted; this I hated; I always hated
it. I hate it still, though I was made to
drink it daily for more than a year, and
had I been like some men, I should now be
a drunkard; but I have not tasted a drop
of ardent spirits or beer since I left the
asylum, and never shall, unless it is forced
down my throat as it was there. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
opinion is, however, that the beer I drank
there never injured me, but the other medicine
I thought did.</p>

<p>Four months had now gone by since I
entered the asylum. I was now on the first
floor. This is a spacious hall, two hundred
and fifteen feet long, with bed-rooms ranged
on each side of it to contain about forty
patients. The patients on this hall are
mostly those who have been on other halls,
and are either cured or convalescent; but
few on this hall are ever seen to show
marks of insanity.</p>

<p>To judge of the inmates of the asylum,
and the workings of the institution by inspecting
this hall, would be a deception.
All things here are in order, with a fine
library and reading room, with bureaus and
looking glasses in all the bed-rooms.</p>

<p>When I came on to the first hall, I little
understood what was before me; I did not
know that I was to remain on this floor for
two years longer, confined by iron grates
and locks; but such was the fact, though I
was in as good health the day I entered it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
as when I left it, but was not in as good
spirits.</p>

<p>For the first three months I occupied a
bed in one of the dormitories where there
were four beds, and during this time I took
care of my own bed, and helped others in
the room who were weaker than myself.
I had a warm place to sleep, and had the
privilege of managing my own clothing.
Our cast-off clothing at night were not left
out in the hall, as on other halls; yet the
patients here are all locked into their rooms
at night as on other halls; and instead of
retiring at seven o'clock, the time of retiring
is half past eight. This to me was a
great relief.</p>

<p>This was a very hard winter; the cold
was intense; the hall was much colder than
any house I had ever been accustomed to
during my whole life. My clothing was
thinner than I had been accustomed to for
thirty years, and we were not allowed to
put on an overcoat, or wear a shawl in the
house, yet my health was good during the
whole winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>The halls were heated with hot air
thrown in through pipes from the engine-house
on the opposite side of the court
yard. The reading room was always comfortable,
but I did not stay in it perhaps
six hours during the whole winter.</p>

<p>One circumstance connected with my
captivity, I cannot pass over. I found when
I arrived at Utica that I had no glasses,
and although they were in my trunk, I did
not know it, as they had taken charge of
my trunk, with all its contents, which I
never saw again until it was brought down
at the time I finally left. I asked for
glasses, that I might occupy my time in
reading. This was denied me, and the doctor
forbade my reading anything whatever.
I thought this a hard case. I could not see
the point, inasmuch as I saw others reading
who were not half as strong as I was&#8212;patients
who were confined to their beds
had their books and papers to read, while
I was waiting on them. I came to the conclusion
that it was done to punish me, or
to let me know that I must obey orders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
So I spent the winter the best I could,
straining my eyes to read whenever I could
get out of the sight of the attendants, that
they might not report me to the doctor;
and it was quite remarkable that I could
read so well without glasses.</p>

<p>Six months perhaps passed away before
I was furnished with glasses. I then took
to reading, asking no questions, and no one
forbade me. Many a volume, could they
speak, in that library, could testify that I
searched their contents.</p>

<p>Soon after I went to the first hall I commenced
walking out with the patients,
accompanied by an attendant. It was our
custom to go into the street that leads from
Utica to Whitesborough, and follow up
that road until we came to the bridge
which crosses the canal, a distance of about
a mile and a half; here we would stop a
few minutes and walk back. This we
repeated almost every day through the
winter.</p>

<p>After I went on to the first hall, I was a
constant attendant at church, either in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
chapel in the asylum, or in the city, or
both. I generally attended the State Street
Methodist Episcopal Church in the city.
The services in the chapel are generally
Episcopal, Dr. Gibson, of Utica, being the
chaplain. I confess that I did not enjoy
public worship while in the asylum as I
have since I left it.</p>

<p>There was one idea that constantly
haunted my mind during the most of the
time that I was in the asylum: that was,
that I should never get away from that
place alive, and this I often expressed to
others. This, perhaps, may be regarded
by others as a freak of insanity, but I could
not help it&#8212;I had my own reasons for
thinking so.</p>

<p>I never saw the day, from the time I entered
the asylum until I left it, but I would
have been willing to have crawled upon
my hands and feet a hundred miles, and
lived on bread and water, could I by that
means have got away; and yet I was resolved
that I would never run away if I died
in the institution. Here I think I was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
an error; I have no doubt but a man is justifiable
in running away when he sees and
knows he is receiving no benefit from staying
there. I think it would be very difficult
to keep me there again as long under
the same circumstances. Why should a
man feel any conscientious scruples about
leaving a place into which he is forced
against his will, especially if he was not
sent there for crime?</p>

<p>My conscientious scruples about running
away from that place, is to me one of the
strongest evidences that I can think of, that
my mind, some of the time, was not right.</p>

<p>At the time I was changed to the first
hall, I was placed at the table by the side
of Dr. Noise, who had been in the institution
for three or four years. He carried
the keys of the house, went in and out at
his will, and served as usher to the asylum.
I supposed he was employed by the doctor
as an helper in the institution, and had no
idea that he was a patient. I observed he
acted very independently, and was quite
dictatorial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>I did not take pains to make his acquaintance,
so I said nothing to him for perhaps
two weeks. In the meantime I had learned
his history&#8212;that he was a patient, and
that in consequence of his being an active
kind of a man, and being a physician at the
same time, and not much, if any, insane, was
granted privileges that but few patients
enjoyed.</p>

<p>I observed that he wanted a great deal
of room at the table, and took it without
consulting the convenience of his next
neighbor. I found myself much cramped
for room, and his course became quite annoying
to me. He would spread himself
out, lay his arms on the table, slop over his
tea and coffee on the table-cloth, throw his
meat and potatoes off of his plate if he did
not want to eat them, and had very much
to say to other patients while eating. On
one occasion he took his seat at the table
before I did, spread himself out as usual,
and laid his arm on my knife. I took my
seat as usual, and sat awhile to see if he
meant to remove his arm off of my knife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
I saw that he did not mean to do so. I did
not understand his object, but I soon found
it was to draw me out in conversation, as I
had not as yet spoken to him, and he began
to feel annoyed about it. I at length asked
him to remove his arm that I might take
my knife.</p>

<p>He turned and looked daggers at me.
&#8220;What,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have you spoken? I
have sat by you two weeks, and you have
not spoken to me; you need not try to play
possum with me?&#8221; &#8220;What do you mean,&#8221;
I said, &#8220;by playing possum?&#8221; He gave
his definition of the saying. I then said,
&#8220;Doctor, I feel under no obligations to
you; I know no reason why I should make
conversation with you more than others.&#8221;
This offended him; he lifted up his voice
and said, &#8220;He did not wonder I was in the
asylum&#8212;that my folks could not live with
me at home, so they had to bring me to the
asylum.&#8221;</p>

<p>I admitted all his slang to be true, and
said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> &#8220;Yes, yes, doctor, that's so&#8212;you and
I are here for the same reason, our folks
could not live with us at home, so they
sent us here.&#8221; This roused the lion&#8212;and
he could roar terribly when roused&#8212;but I
said no more, and as my reply got the
laugh of the table on him, he cooled off,
but he never tried me on again. Whether
he thought he had caught a tartar, or
whether he thought I was a fool and not
worth minding, he did not inform me; but
one thing I do know, that ever after this
he treated me with respect, and died in the
asylum in about two years from that time.</p>

<p>As I have already noticed, this is called
the first hall on the gentlemen's side, and
is on the first floor above the basement.
Between this, and what was then called the
fourth hall, now I believe called the second,
is a billiard room. The patients amuse
themselves at this game, and some of them
are expert players. I never took any interest
in it; I never even took the stick in my
hand to strike a ball while there,&#8212;neither
did I ever elsewhere.</p>

<p>Chess, checkers, backgammon and dominoes,
were the principal games played in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the asylum, but in none of these did I
take any interest; indeed, I never learned
to play them. I think if all these games
could be confined to lunatic asylums it
would be just as well for the world.</p>

<p>As the time of retirement on this floor is
just half-past eight in the evening, there is
considerable time during the long nights
of winter for some kind of exercise between
dark and bed-time. So after the hall
is lighted up, the patients betake themselves
to such kinds of recreation as suits
them best&#8212;some to reading, some to walking
the hall in pairs, which is a good exercise,
others engage in the different games
practiced on the hall, while some will
always sit looking blank, as though all the
world besides them were asleep or dead.</p>

<p>There is a state of mind in that institution
which I have thought would not be
moved if the house were on fire. I once
saw it demonstrated on the fourth hall. A
young man was brought on to that hall by
his friends from the city of Utica, subject
to epileptic fits; these fits had injured his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
mind very much; yet he was as harmless
as a child, and a greater mistake never happened
than to take a child to the lunatic
asylum who has fits, thinking they can be
benefited by it; but if it is done to get the
child out of their sight, and to throw the
care of them on to other hands, why then,
that alters the case; but if that were my
object, I certainly should not send them
there; I would sooner send them to the
county poor-house.</p>

<p>But to return to my story. He was sitting
at the table; I think it was breakfast;
we had all commenced eating; in a moment
he fell backward chair and all, with a terrible
groan, foaming at the mouth, and
uttering most horrible groans; I started up
as by instinct; my knife and fork dropped
from my hands, and I was about to take
hold of him to take him up, when two
attendants took him up and carried him to
his room. But I observed that more than
half of those at the table never looked up
nor stopped eating. I made up my mind
that if they had been asked after breakfast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
what happened at the breakfast table this
morning, the would have said, &#8220;nothing
that they knew of.&#8221; That was the state of
mind I wanted to be in when I entered the
asylum; then I should have had no trouble
by anything I saw or heard. I do not
wish the reader to understand that I <i>now</i>
wish that to have been my state of mind.</p>

<p>Though it may seem a digression from
the subject designed in this chapter, yet,
while I am on the subject of epileptic fits,
I wish to relate a fact which has come
under my observation within a few weeks
past. I was in a town in the northern part
of Saratoga county about the 25th of June,
1868; and while there I was told that one
of their neighbors was about to take their
son to the Asylum at Utica, who was subject
to epileptic fits, and they asked my
advice. The brother of the young man
who had fits was present. They did not
know, that I am aware of, that I had any
knowledge of the asylum. I asked them
why they were going to take him to the
asylum? I saw that he hesitated to answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
He finally said they thought it would be
best. I asked him if they thought the doctors
there could help one with fits better
than other doctors?</p>

<p>I then told him just what I thought,
&#8220;that many had been deceived by supposing
they could cure epileptic fits at the asylum,
and that they would miss it if they took him
there for that purpose.&#8221; They were entire
strangers to everything pertaining to the
asylum, yet I saw they were intent upon
taking the young man there. They started
with him the next morning, and took him
to the asylum.</p>

<p>After the young man, the brother of the
patient, had left, the family where I stopped
explained to me the probable reasons why
they were going to send him to the asylum.
The young man had become of age, and was
not capable of supporting himself; they
were afraid he was getting, or would get,
suicidal; he was getting to be a burden to
the family.</p>

<p>His own mother was dead, and he had a
step-mother. If they put him in the asylum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
they would get rid of the trouble of
looking after him, and would save his support
by throwing him into the asylum as a
county charge. Yet they were not poor.
There can be no doubt but many are sent
there for similar reasons.</p>

<p>I was greatly surprised to find children
in the asylum not more than six or seven
years old. I saw two little boys there, one
from Rondout, of about that age. Poor
things, how I pitied them. They were
very sprightly little fellows, but it was
said they had epileptic fits. I would think
it much more appropriate to send a child
there that had the measles, or one troubled
with worms, than to send one there troubled
with fits, for, I think likely, they
might cure the measles, and I am sure they
would give medicine enough to kill the
worms.</p>

<p>I will now return to the first hall, and
give a description of the patients on that
floor. I have already said that generally
there are about forty patients on this hall,
perhaps a little less; there are constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
changes on this hall of patients. When
patients are first brought in they are seldom
left on this floor, though some are. Some
come on this hall and never go to any other.
They come and stay from three months to
a year, and sometimes longer, as the case
may be, and leave almost entirely ignorant
of the general state of things in the asylum.
And some of this class are well pleased
with the asylum; this depends much on
who they are, and what the state of their
body and mind was in while there.</p>

<p>But the great majority first have a schooling
on other halls, and, if very insane, are
quite likely to be sent on the old eleventh,
which, I believe, is now changed to some
other number, but the hall is the same.
This hall is the most like hell, in my judgment,
so far as we have any knowledge of
what hell is, of any other place on earth.
I recollect when I was there, I used to fear
and tremble, lest I should be sent on
to the eleventh; and it was a common thing
for attendants to scare patients, by telling
them they would report them to the doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
and have them sent on to the eleventh
hall.</p>

<p>This is a low small hall, on the ground
floor, in the west end of the wing, made of
brick, and, I think, but one story high.
Here men are bound in fetters and laid in
irons! Many of them are so crazy they
are obliged to be kept bound, some in cribs,
some hand-cuffed, some tied down in seats,
some with muffs, and many of them in strait
jackets. I am not censuring anybody for
this, unless it be the patients themselves,
who have brought themselves to this state
by imprudence and debauchery. As to the
treatment of these, I have no knowledge,
only by hearsay. I have often heard many
hard stories concerning their treatment,
but there can be no doubt, that means that
would seem to be rash has to be sometimes
used, to bring to bearings some of these
raving maniacs.</p>

<p>Their food, I understand, is as good as
in any other department in the institution,
but the manner of eating it is different.
They are not allowed knives and forks, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
eat with spoons; their food being prepared
and put on their plates by the attendants.
As these patients improve, they are changed
to other halls more appropriate to their
state, until some of them finally get to the
first hall. Not that all come on to the first
hall who get well and are discharged from
the asylum, yet many come on the first hall
from other floors, and many are discharged
from the first hall and go home, making
constant changes on that floor. I visited
the asylum in April last, and found eight
persons on the first floor, who were there
three years ago, when I left; some of these
seem to be fixtures. I could give the names
of these, but perhaps they would regard it
a freedom which I had no right to take;
so I will forbear. There is a kind of mystery
attached to the history of some of
these men. One of them, a well, hearty
man of about forty, who has been there
about six years, and he told me he had not
taken a dose of medicine since he entered
the institution; and no man would think of
charging him with insanity; and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
often said, and say now, that a man must
be made of stern stuff that can remain shut
up there for six years, in the prime of life,
amidst the howlings and babblings of five
hundred maniacs, and not become insane!</p>

<p>There are a number of others who have
been there from ten to fifteen years, who
show but slight marks of insanity; if any,
perfectly harmless. There are many out in
the world doing business quite as crazy as
they. These, I know, are all groaning to
get free, but their friends prefer to keep
them there, and as property doubtless has
much to do with the matter, they will be
likely to die in the institution. Were they
county patients, they would long before
now have been set at liberty.</p>

<p>There is one case in the asylum that I
will venture to name, because I am quite
sure he would prefer to have me do so.
This case is Frank Jones. He has been
there a number of years. He is troubled
with epileptic fits; these fits have somewhat
impaired his mind. He is as harmless
as a child; is capable of doing considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
business of a certain kind. He has his
liberty to go about where he pleases; he
does a great many chores for the doctor;
goes into the city daily, to the post-office
and stores; dresses very neatly, is perfectly
honest and truthful, and can be trusted
in any matter. He occupies the first hall;
is a private patient, and is the son of Mrs.
Jones, the owner of the Clarendon House
at Saratoga Springs&#8212;one of the best houses
in that place.</p>

<p>I have often had talk with Frank on the
subject of his being in the asylum; he
seems to feel bad at times that his mother
chooses to keep him in the asylum. I had
the opportunity of watching him for two
years. I have seen him have his fits; he is
very little trouble to any one when he has
them; he generally so manages as to have
them in his room on his bed.</p>

<p>It is true that this is not my business,
but were he my son, and knowing what I
know of asylum life, I should remove him
to some private family, where he could
enjoy the comfort of social life, if I did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
want the trouble of looking after him myself;
it could not cost any more than to
keep him in the asylum.</p>

<p>There is one more man in the institution
of which I will say a word in this connection.
His room is on the old fourth hall,
now called the second; this is Esq. Bebee.
He was in the old asylum at Hudson, I am
told, before the one at Utica was established;
and on the opening of the one in
Utica, in 1842, he was removed there, and
I think has been there ever since. He was
a lawyer of superior talents. I understood
he fell from a horse and fractured his skull,
that a portion of his brains ran out, and
they were preserved.</p>

<p>He is a very eccentric man, and has a
very lofty bearing. I have heard him speak
a number of times, and have heard him
make some of the most able and thrilling
speeches I have ever heard from any man.
He keeps his room the most of the time;
has his liberty; goes where he pleases, but
will doubtless die in the institution. He
frequently shows marks of insanity, not by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
any low or foolish expression, but by some
sudden outburst of eloquence, or some
ludicrous and eccentric act.</p>

<p>He is always very tenacious about having
any one come into his room. I once saw a
poor fellow who hardly knew what he was
doing, step into Bebee's room just as he was
coming out. Bebee met him at the door, and
with a lofty swagger, exclaimed, with a
good deal of energy, &#8220;Scoundrel, many a
man has been shot for a less offence than
that.&#8221; The poor fellow sneaked off without
saying a word. One day he went to the city,
I was told, and while out lost his brains,
which he had always carried carefully done
up in his pocket. On his return he said,
&#8220;I have lost my brains out of my pocket&#8212;the
people now won't believe that I have
any brains, as I can no longer show them.&#8221;</p>

<p>I recollect that during the time I was on
that hall, Bebee went out on a visit to see
his friends, and was gone some three weeks.
It has always been a mystery to me why he
should stay there. There is no doubt but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
he would have been discharged long ago,
had he been a county patient.</p>

<p>I will venture to name another particular
case with which I deeply sympathize,
trusting that he will not be offended that I
have made mention of his name. This is
Alexander Hamilton Malcrum, a grandson of
old Gen. Schuyler, and nephew of the celebrated
Alexander Hamilton. He has been in
the asylum quite a number of years&#8212;is a
man of good education, having been educated
at Hamilton College, and is not insane.
It is true he is a little eccentric, and so are
many other men out of the asylum. He is
groaning to be set free&#8212;is capable of doing
business&#8212;is middle aged. I regard it a
great cruelty that he is kept there so long.
I have had long and frequent talks with
him on the subject. He has property. I
think his brother at Oswego would interest
himself to get him away could he know the
real facts as to asylum life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p>The holidays of 1863 came, and I saw
that the attendants, and many of the patients
of the first floor, were busily engaged
in dressing up the hall, the billiard
room and the chapel, with evergreens.
The chapel is in the fourth story of the
center building, and is reached by three
long flights of stairs from the lower floors,
rendering it very hard for old and infirm
people to reach it. At times I found it
very difficult, on account of lameness, to
ascend these stairs.</p>

<p>Above the chapel, in the fifth story, is a
theater; this was fitted up the first year I
was in the institution. This I suppose was
done for the amusement of the patients,
and during my stay there quite a number
of scenes were acted, on the merits of which
I am not able to give any opinion, as I
am not acquainted with theatrical performances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
having never attended one before I
went to an insane asylum. I made up my
mind, however, from what I saw, that they
were very appropriate to a lunatic asylum,
and that it is quite likely that in the first
instance they were got up for the sole purpose
of cheering and amusing disordered
minds, and that by some unaccountable
means they made their escape from the
lunatic asylum, and have ever since been
running at large through the world.</p>

<p>I think it would be one of the most humane
and charitable acts that our country
could perform, to pass an act to place all
the theaters back into insane asylums,
where they appropriately belong.</p>

<p>The first performance of the kind I ever
saw, I think, was in January of 1864. The
supervisor, Mr. Butler, said to me I must
prepare myself to go down to Mechanics'
Hall, in the city, as some performances
were to be acted there that afternoon and
evening. I begged to be excused, but
there was no use in talking; so I got ready.
I recollect that about a score of us poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
lunatics, were marched off to the city. I
shall never forget how I felt when I reached
there. It seemed to me that all eyes were
turned upon us, as they knew we came
from the asylum; perhaps I was a little too
sensitive on this point. I looked on, or
pretended to look on, but I did it mostly
with my eyes shut. I took no interest in
the whole matter. I only went to obey
orders; but I was a good deal like the
horse who would not drink after he was
led to the water. If there is any sanitive
power in knowing we must obey, then I
suppose I was benefited; so I walked down
the hill, and walked up again. So we were
a privileged people; we could go to the
theatre, dance, play at billiards, attend
church, drink whiskey or porter, and all
sanctioned by law.</p>

<p>On this hall there is something of a
library, containing, perhaps, five or six
hundred volumes, besides papers, both daily
and weekly, that are brought on to the
hall; so that all who desire reading can
have it. Patients from other halls frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
come down and get books, read
and return them.</p>

<p>As to religious service, it is regular once
a week, every Sabbath evening, so that all
who desire to attend church can have the
privilege in the chapel. Besides this, there
are quite a number, such as the doctor
pleases to select, who have the privilege of
going into the city to church, accompanied
by an attendant, who goes to see that they
keep orderly and return home at the close
of service.</p>

<p>I observed that people of all creeds were
in the institution&#8212;Episcopalians, Methodists,
Baptists, Presbyterians, Roman Catholics,
Quakers, Unitarians, Universalists and
Swedenburghers, so that no one denomination
can boast that their members are
never insane. I judge, however, that there
are more Roman Catholics, compared with
their numbers, than any others in the
asylum.</p>

<p>Another inquiry arose in my mind while
in the asylum, viz.: What class of the inhabitants
form the majority in that institution?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
This is rather a hard question; yet,
perhaps, we can arrive at something near
the truth on the subject. In doing this I
will divide society into four classes, as follows:
first, professional men and men of
study; secondly, business men, who have
much care on their minds; thirdly, the common
laboring class, which compose the
great majority of mankind; fourthly, that
floating unsettled class of men, who live as
they can catch it, with no settled business,
and indulge in drinking and in other loose
habits of life.</p>

<p>Some of each and all of these classes are
found in the asylum&#8212;doctors, lawyers and
ministers of the gospel, with students from
colleges, are often found in the asylum;
yet their number appears small compared
to the other classes, but it must be remembered
that this is by far the smallest of the
four classes of community. I judge that
this class is as about one to fifty of the
second and fourth class, and as about one
to two hundred of the third or laboring
class, so that if ten professional men are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
found in the asylum, with three hundred of
the other classes, it would show a large
proportion of professional men in the
asylum. But I do not think that this class
will average more than six to three hundred
of the other classes; this is giving a
very large proportion of professional men
to the asylum compared to other classes.
I think, perhaps, I have the numbers too
high. All I can say of this class then is,
that education and study is not a safe-guard
to insanity, but sometimes may produce
it; yet it is thought very strange by some,
that a man of mind, study and education,
should ever become insane.</p>

<p>There are some men who need never fear
of becoming insane&#8212;their minds are not
sufficiently active&#8212;they will never rack
their minds with study&#8212;in a word, they
have not brains enough to become insane.
As to the second class, they are quite liable
to overtax the mind with the burthen of
their business. I judge this from their numbers
found in the asylum. I cannot say,
however, that I have seen as many of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
class in the asylum, according to their numbers,
as I have of the first class.</p>

<p>Of the third, or laboring class of community,
there are a great number in the
asylum. Many of these suffer in various
ways, and from various causes. Some, by
overwork, undermine their constitutions;
some, by exposure to all weathers, become
prostrated, and their nerves unstrung.
And many in this class, as well as in others,
have greatly injured their nervous system
by the excessive use of coffee, tea and
tobacco. It is a remarkable fact that but
few men are found in the asylum who are
not users of tobacco; and the universal cry
of the patients through all the asylum for
tobacco, is proof of this fact. I think there
are five to one of this class in the asylum
compared to the other classes; yet, perhaps,
they number ten to one of all the other
classes.</p>

<p>The fourth class is that reckless and unsettled
portion of community that never
look beyond present gratification, whatever
it may cost. Rum, tobacco and idleness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
constitute their chief study; habits unfixed;
system in living never enters their thoughts;
and though this is not the larger class of
community, I doubt not but two to one of
this class are found in the asylum to any
other class of society.</p>

<p>It is a given fact that a great number in
the asylum were brought there by their
dissipation. It is not strange that many
of all the classes mentioned should be found
in the asylum, but to see the imbecile and
driveling idiot thrown into a lunatic asylum,
carries <i>prima facie</i> evidence with it, that
the object in placing them there was not
to prevent their doing injury to themselves
or others, nor for their recovery from their
unfortunate state, for many of these were
born so. If the parents or guardians of
these unfortunate cases are not able to support
and take care of them, let these turn
them over to the county where they belong,
for it would be much better for such to be
in the county house, than to be shut up in a
lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>There is a striking fact that will appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to any observer who will take the trouble
to read the printed statistics of the number
of patients in the asylum at Utica, and the
counties to which they belong. He will
find that some of the remote counties send
one, some two, and some none, while those
near by will send scores. I presume that
the large cities of the State, such as New
York, Brooklyn, Albany, Troy, Buffalo and
Rochester, that all these cities do not send
as many patients to the asylum as is sent
by the little city of Utica, which does not
contain over 25,000 inhabitants! This may
seem a startling assertion, but I have known
at one time in the asylum sixty patients
from the city of Utica.</p>

<p>Can it be proved that the above named
cities ever had sixty patients in that
asylum at any one time? It would take a
hundred such asylums to take all that the
State of New York would furnish if each
county should send as many as the city of
Utica, according to their number of inhabitants.</p>

<p>Perhaps it will be said that this fact is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
all in favor of the institution; that Utica
knows better the worth of the institution
than places more remote, and this is the
reason why so many more are furnished
from Utica. I am fully satisfied that the
citizens of Utica know no more about the
private workings of that institution than the
inhabitants of Clinton and Essex counties;
and living near by renders them more
liable to be deceived, and in the following
manner: It is known by all the inhabitants
of that region of country round about Utica,
that the asylum is open every day at certain
hours, for the reception of visitors.
It is also understood by the managers and
attendants at the asylum, that visitors are
expected every day, more or less; so that
all things are put in order before visitors
come; every unsightly thing is put out of
the way; all is still and clean as a ladies'
parlor on the first halls, on both sides of
the house; the time comes; the usher is at
the door; the visitors are led through
the first halls, look at the pictures and
leave. What do they know by this running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
visit about the asylum? It is true,
they have seen the neatness and order of
the two lower halls&#8212;the lovely flower
garden&#8212;the beautiful lawn spread out from
the out-stretched and towering walls of the
asylum, to the archway that leads to the
street below; the view is lovely.</p>

<p>My daughter visited me in my prison-house
after I had been there ten months,
and she is a lover of the beautiful&#8212;she
exclaimed, after she had feasted her eyes
on all around in full bloom in the month of
July, &#8220;<i>O pa, it is a paradise; I should like
to live here</i>.&#8221; Tears filled my eyes, though
I had not shed one tear for a year; my grief
had been too deep for tears. &#8220;Poor child,&#8221;
thought I, &#8220;I hope you will never be
undeceived by being placed here as a
patient.&#8221;</p>

<p>No, it is not because the people of Utica
know better about the institution than
others that they send so many there. It is
true they know the managers of the institution,
the steward, and Dr. Gray. But
Dr. Gray himself does not know one-half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
that is done in that place of deception. If
I thought he did, and tolerated it, I should
have far less respect for him than I now
have.</p>

<p>I know a gentlemen living not far from
Utica, of prominence and standing in community&#8212;a
man of wealth and large business&#8212;has
held the highest office in his
town for years, and had often visited the
asylum, and walked through its halls, and
had boasted of the value and utility of such
an institution, and was proud that he had
taken an interest in the erection of so magnificent
a pile&#8212;who does not feel now as
he then felt&#8212;and why? Why? for the
very plain reason, that since that time he
has been initiated into the secrets of the
institution. This man is no other than D.
J. Millard, Esq., of Oneida County.</p>

<p>He was, like myself, unfortunately thrown
into that institution as a patient. I
saw him the day he entered it. I saw he
was a man of more than ordinary ability;
he was one of those business men I have
described in this chapter; I formed his acquaintance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
in the asylum; he was not insane,
his health became poor; his business
lay heavily upon his mind, and he partially
sunk down under the burthen. Difficulties
magnified in his mind beyond what were
the real facts. But an insane asylum was
not the place to cure him; it was the very
worst place, in my judgment, that could
have been chosen for the relief of his mind.</p>

<p>Encouragement and cheerful greetings
was what he needed, instead of imprisonment
and seclusion from his business and
his family. But he lived in spite of all
these opposing influences, and came out of
his troubles a wiser, and no doubt, a better
man, for his sufferings. Would he recommend
a friend to place one of his family
in that institution?</p>

<p>He is not a man who is carried away by
low and petty prejudices&#8212;he sees things
in a broad and philosophical light; he believes
that such an institution could be, and
should be, a blessing to the State and Nation,
and that it would be, were it conducted
as it should be; but as it is, and as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
has been managed for a few years past, he
regards it a curse to the land, and unless reformed,
will one day fall by its own weight.</p>

<p>The light is already breaking in through
its dark and massive walls, and when men
can be placed over it who can feel for suffering
humanity, instead of glorying in a
little power over helpless invalids, and
seeking how they can make the most profits
at the expense of the sufferings of their
fellow beings, then, and not till then, will
the darkness and gloom, which has so long
hung over that prison house of death, roll
off, causing the tongue of the dumb to sing,
and many a bleeding heart to rejoice.</p>

<p>As to the nationality of the inmates of
that institution, it may almost be said, that
they are from all nations, tongues and languages.
There is the American of the Anglo-Saxon
race, the Welshman, the Scotchman,
the Irishman, the German, the Swede,
the Frenchman, the North American Indian,
the African and the Jew. I have
thought it partook very largely of the Irish
race&#8212;I think so still; so that that institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
may be said to be the world in miniature.</p>

<p>There are the rich and the poor&#8212;the
black and the white&#8212;the wise and the ignorant&#8212;the
learned and the unlearned&#8212;the
Devil and the Saint&#8212;the Christian and
the infidel&#8212;the drunkard and the man of
temperance&#8212;the libertine and the man of
chastity&#8212;the thief and murderer&#8212;the man
of honesty and kindness&#8212;the child and the
man of gray hairs.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>The winter of 1863 and 1864 had nearly
worn away, and I heard nothing from any
of my friends, nor had I seen but one person
that I ever knew before I entered the
asylum. What winter clothing I had left
were worn nearly out; my vest was very
ragged; my pants were quite thin; as
yet I made out very well for coats, such
as they were. I forgot to say, that besides
the broadcloth coat that I had taken
from me, I had also a farmer's satin coat
taken about the same time, and another
given in its stead. This I regarded as an
insult, for the one given me was old, rusty,
cut in an other form, and quite too small,
my arms extending some distance beyond
the ends of the sleeves. I could not help
laughing when I put it on. I never wore
it three days while there, I keep it yet as a
curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>On thinking over all these matters, and
looking at my ludicrous plight, I felt that
Heaven and earth had turned against me. I
then thought that could I have had a friend
to whom I could have spoken freely, to
whom I could have poured out the feelings of
my heart, I could have got relief, but I had
no such friend. What I had already said
about my loss of clothing had only caused
a sharp rebuke; no one would hear my
story and pretend to believe it; so I was
dumb.</p>

<p>I had been ordered into the dining room
to assist in doing up the work after meals.
This was awkward business for me at first. I
had never been in the habit of washing
dishes, but I commenced my apprenticeship
feeling quite indifferent whether I succeeded
in learning the trade or not.</p>

<p>After preparing myself for the work, by
laying off my coat, and putting on an apron,
as the custom was, I could not help comparing
my present condition with my
former one, ten months before. To say
that I felt humbled and even crushed, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
no words to describe my feelings at that
time.</p>

<p>Soon after this, when in this condition,
dressed in my apron, with sleeves rolled
up and dish-cloth in hand, I was called to
step into the side hall; I did so, and who
did I meet but an old friend and parishoner,
now living in Albany&#8212;his name was Hoxsie.
He was very neatly dressed, but I observed
he looked sad as he looked upon me, in my
shirt sleeves, apron on, pants ragged, and
my vest worn all out. I was not glad to
see him while in this plight, for he had
never seen me before only in the capacity
of a Pastor, decently dressed. I know
I appeared very much embarrassed and
eccentric when we met. I did not know
what to say or do. Many things rushed
upon my mind which I wanted to say to
him, which I could not, for I knew we were
watched by an attendant, and every word
would be marked and reported. I knew
he did not understand all this; and besides
this, I knew he had a right to expect that
what I did say would discover traits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
insanity, for all are supposed to be insane
who are in the asylum.</p>

<p>I recollect the first thing I said to him
was to ask him about my family, whether
they were well, and where they were? He
could give no information about them. I told
him this was a horrible place; that he could
know nothing about it by such a visit. I
asked him what the people were going to
do with me. I saw he looked embarrassed;
he did not take my meaning. I meant he
should take the hint, that I wanted my
friends to interest themselves in getting me
away. I pointed him to my pants, and
asked him if I could not have a new pair.
I doubt whether I said anything about the
loss of my clothes, as we were watched.
He made me an indifferent reply when I
spoke to him about the pants. I saw I
should get no help from that direction.</p>

<p>He seemed to be in a hurry, so he rose
and left. He is a fine and good man, and
if he ever sees this, he will know more about
my feelings at that time than he then knew.</p>

<p>It was not long after this before the doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
ordered the supervisor to take me to
the city, and get me a suit of clothes. We
went down, but I felt a great reluctance in
going; not that I did not need the clothes,
but I felt somehow that I did not want any
new clothes got me while there. I wanted
to get away, and I feared if I got a new
suit that I should stay until they were
worn out, and my fears were realized.</p>

<p>It was left with me to choose such a suit
as I pleased. I selected a strong, common
suit instead of a fine one; in this I was
right, as I stayed there until it was about
worn out. I now appeared to a little better
advantage on the hall. The patients
are expected to dress a little better on this
hall than they are required to do on the
back halls.</p>

<p>April now came, and quite a number of
patients, who had been on the hall through
the winter, now left for home. I had made
the acquaintance of these, and to some of
them was warmly attached; when they left
my spirits sunk down for a season. I was
left behind, and some of those who left had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
come into the asylum subsequently to my
entering it. There was one Dr. Brown,
from New York city, who left; he was a
Quaker; a fine fellow, but subject to depression,
having had some trouble, perhaps,
of a domestic character. I was surprised
a year after to see him through the window
in the yard with raving maniacs. He saw
me and hailed me. He had been in the
asylum a number of weeks at this time; he
soon came on to the first hall, stayed a few
weeks, and left for home for the second
time, long before I left.</p>

<p>One fact was quite observable in relation
to patients, to illustrate: A man or woman
comes into the institution a raving maniac,
hand-cuffed, and hair dishevelled, foaming
at the mouth and uttering hideous yells;
they are ordered on the old eleventh, for
instance. Nothing more is heard from them
perhaps for three or six months, when all
at once, they are introduced by the doctor,
or the supervisor, to the patients on the
first floor; they are sober and in their right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
mind; they stay a few weeks longer and
return home.</p>

<p>But these, I find, are liable to a relapse,
and often return the second, and third, and
even the fourth time. These are excitable
temperaments, and when their nerves become
unstrung, there is no holding them, so
they are brought to the asylum. They only
want rest, and to be kept clear from excitement;
any other place would be as good
as the asylum if they could be controlled.
Another comes into the asylum gloomy and
sober, with his head down; is still and
harmless; talks to none; shows no marks
of insanity; except, perhaps, you hear him
groan or sigh occasionally; he sets down
alone. He stops perhaps on the first hall
when he first comes to the institution; stays
there three months, and perhaps a year;
when he is found to be no better, but
worse, he is finally placed on some of the
back halls; gets no better, is changed from
one hall to another, till finally is pronounced
demented; he lingers on, and either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
become a fixture in the asylum or dies
there! Such is asylum life.</p>

<p>I know one man, a dentist, who has been
in the asylum ten times at least. There is
a young man by the name of Bouck, from
Schoharie, who has often been in the asylum.
He comes under a high pressure of
excitement; stays a few months and leaves.
But while there, is regarded the lion of the
establishment; fears nothing; is a giant in
strength; will dash out windows with iron
grates as though they were made of cobwebs;
will climb on the side of the wall
where no sane man would dare to venture.
For such a case, perhaps the asylum is of
some value.</p>

<p>As the spring of 1864 had now opened,
I looked out with surprise that I had lived
through the winter. I confess that when
winter set in, I did not expect to see the
leaves put forth again. Not that I was
sick, but I did not believe that I could
bear up under the pressure that lay upon
my mind. There was some cause for this.
A little before I left the fourth hall in December,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
I had a weak turn; I would attempt
to rise in the morning after a sleepless
night, and would fall back faint and weak
upon my bed. Had I been anywhere but
in a lunatic asylum, I should have lain
down quietly until my strength had rallied,
but I dared not do it, (I confess I feared
the attendants' ire), so I would rally all my
energies and get up, dress me and make
my bed the best I could, concealing my
weakness from the attendants, for I knew
to make it known would not help me.</p>

<p>One morning when I was making my
bed, the attendant stepped into my room.
I then took occasion to tell him my feelings,
and said that I did not know but I
should be unable to rise in the morning
with the rest, and if it should happen I
wished him to treat me as favorably as he
could. He replied that all the treatment I
should get in that case, would be that he
would wait for me just ten minutes after
the signal was given for getting up. I
replied that I should do the very best I
could, and then must suffer the consequences.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
But by the blessing of God, I
was ever after that able to get up, dress
and make my bed, while I remained in the
institution.</p>

<p>The impression was indelibly fixed on
my mind, that for me to become helpless
in that institution, would be the same to
me as death. I was, soon after this, removed
to the first hall. As the spring opened
I went out with the men to work on the
lawn. The first work I did out door was
to rake the old dead grass off the lawn
into heaps. It was then drawn off with
hand-carts. I had had a broken arm the
year before, which crippled my right hand
so that I was not able to do much; besides
this, I had not been used to work since I was
a young man, and to be ordered about by
an ignorant attendant boy, did not go down
very smoothly; however, I tried to make
the best of it. I suppose the main reason
why I did not leave the institution without
liberty was, that I knew the authorities
had power to take me back without a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
order, and hold me until legally discharged
or released by the doctor.</p>

<p>Summer came, and I went into the field
with other patients to work; the weather
was hot. I recollect of looking about me
and seeing a motley group of lunatics, some
cursing, some yelling, while others were
keeping up a constant ribaldry of blackguarding
and obscene language.</p>

<p>I though of home and of friends; I compared
my present state with the past; I
could hardly believe this was a reality. I
thought I would have given a world, if I
had it, to have impressed on the minds of
my friends at home, and the doctors there,
my thoughts and feelings.</p>

<p>I thought of the convicts of a State prison
that I had seen in the fields at work,
guarded by attendants, as we were, some
with chain and ball attached to their ankles.
The only real difference I could see between
us was, that they were not insane, and they
were there for a definite period of time, and
could look forward to that point with a
certainty of being liberated, if they lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
until that time; we were there to stay until
doomsday, for ought we knew.</p>

<p>I recollect coming in from the field one
day at noon. I was called to the supervisor's
room; he took down a bottle and
poured out a table spoonful of some kind
of liquid, as white as water, and ordered
me to drink it. I had learned before this,
to ask no questions when anything was
given me to drink. I drank it down; he
repeated the dose, and I took it. He saw
that I writhed under it. He said I must
come to his room three times a day before
eating, and take two table-spoonfuls of the
contents of this bottle, until it was all taken
up.</p>

<p>It was a large case bottle, holding, perhaps,
a little more than a quart. I judged
it to be the decoction of quassia wood; at
all events, I had never taken anything
before that compared with it for bitterness.
Said nothing, but a strange feeling came over
me. I was taking other medicine, as usual,
besides this. I felt for the moment that
they, seeing that I was doing well and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
gaining my flesh, took this course to kill
me, by over-dosing me with medicine. It
seemed to me that I could never live to take
all that with my other doses, but I did
take it and live.</p>

<p>But I did not believe then, neither do I
now, that the doctors thought I needed this
in addition to the beer and the other medicine
I was taking three times a day. I
have always believed it was given me to
see if I would not resist. I had never once
resisted taking anything offered, and never
meant to, live or die, for I knew it would
be forced down me if I did; I had frequently
seen the operation performed on
others, and I did not covet the luxury.</p>

<p>Perhaps this conclusion of mine will be
regarded by many as unjust and unreasonable,
who are unacquainted with matters in
that institution, and of course will be
laughed at by those who ordered the medicine.
I would laugh at it too if I were they;
it is the best way for them to dispose of
the matter. Yet my opinion will be the
same; I have my reasons for this. If I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
been running down in health and appetite,
confined to my room or to my bed, such a
course might have seemed justifiable, but I
was well, eating very heartily, working in
the field every day with others.</p>

<p>July came, and I had heard nothing from
my friends, and nothing had been said to
me about writing to them. I had once
asked the privilege of writing to the
man that took me there, but had been
denied.</p>

<p>I was sitting in the reading room one
Sabbath afternoon in July; my anguish of
mind was very intense, as I was considering
my condition&#8212;that my present life was
worse than a blank, shut out as I was from
all knowledge of the outer world, and yet
in a free country. I was not aware that I
had forfeited my liberty by any crime, yet
I was confined by bolts and bars, and if I
was permitted to go outside, was guarded
and watched by a set of ignorant, unprincipled
hirelings. Such were my meditations,
when all of a sudden the newsboy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
announced to me that my daughter had
come and wanted to see me.</p>

<p>I was paralyzed&#8212;I could hardly believe
it&#8212;I thought it must be some one else, for
I knew she lived a thousand miles off. I
rose without speaking and left the hall and
went to the sitting room in the center, and
lo it was my daughter. I shall never forget
that meeting.</p>

<p>When she left us more than a year before,
for the far west, I was in good
health, and all was prosperity with us, and
I was a <i>man</i> in the world like other men,
and a father that she was not ashamed to
own. Now we meet in a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>I shall never forget my first words to
her, even before I had enquired after the
family, putting my face to hers, and pressing
her to my bosom, I said, in a whisper,
for we were watched&#8212;&#8220;for Gods sake
never send one of the family to this place
what ever the consequences may be.&#8221; I
doubted whether she took in my full meaning
at first, from the reply she made, but
afterwards I explained to her what I meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>I have never doubted, but this visit was
the means of prolonging my life, and of
my final release from that prison. She
remained two or three days in the city and
visited me daily while she stayed.</p>

<p>I was permitted to walk out with her in
the garden and through the grounds, I
learned from her that the rest of the family
were all in good health. This was a
great relief to me. I told her many things,
and explained to her the workings of the
institution, as far as I thought it advisible.</p>

<p>I pledged her to keep me advised of all
matters at home, and if possible to get me
out of this place. I knew, however, that if
she did write me, that all would depend
upon the will of the doctor whether I ever
received her letters. It is not very pleasant
to know that a third person has the
power to intercept all letters received from,
or sent to friends.</p>

<p>She talked with Dr. Gray, and he made
her believe it was best for me to remain in
the asylum. I was permitted to visit with
her in the city, and when she was about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
leave, I applied to Dr. Gray to let me leave
the institution, and go home with her. He
was very decided,&#8212;and said, &#8220;as a state
officer, he could not let me go.&#8221; My heart
sunk down.</p>

<p>The time came for her departure; I went
to the city with her; she had her little boy,
her only child with her, of nine or ten years
old. When the moment came for separation,
she and my only grandchild, to go to
her mother, and I to go back to the asylum,
my heart nearly died within me. I bade
her and the child good by, and gave them
my blessing. But, O God! What a moment
was that to me, as I gazed after my
two only children as long as I could catch
a glimpse of them! and then said to myself,
&#8220;shall I ever see them again?&#8221; None but
a father can know how I felt at that moment.
Ah, none but a father in like circumstances
can know how I felt! An
ordinary parting of parents and children is
touching; but one of this kind is beyond
description.</p>

<p>If a man is insane, no such thing moves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
him; he can see his children go and come
unmoved and unaffected, he can see his
children die and not be moved, all things
are alike to him.</p>

<p>I returned to the asylum with a heavy
heart, yet comforted that I had seen my
only beloved children, and thanked God
for the opportunity. By the coming of my
daughter, I formed an acquaintance with
some friends in Utica, who called occasionally
at the asylum to see me.</p>

<p>I have passed over a circumstance which
I will notice in this place. While on the
fourth hall, in about the month of November,
I observed a thick, stout built man
brought in from one of the back halls, and
introduced to the attendant. He had come
from the eleventh hall; he was a bold and
naturally a good feeling man, and, I perceived,
a man of strong impulses; and of
some cultivation, he attracted my attention,
and I perceived he was highly gratified
with his change. On further acquaintance
I found he was a preacher from the New
York Conference; his name I shall withhold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>He had been thrown into the asylum by
his friends, I learned, in consequence of the
high state of excitement his mind got into
by over-working and much care. He was
first put on one of the back halls, and soon
got on to the eleventh. There they have
rough work sometimes. He was under a
high excitement when carried there.</p>

<p>Mr. Vallerly, the attendant, a strong
Irishman, and not overstocked with patience,
took charge of him. The Reverend
gentleman supposed he understood his own
business, and, therefore, was not very
prompt in obeying the strict and iron
rules of the attendant, upon which the
Hibernian drew his fist and knocked him
to the floor, in the meantime giving him a
terrible black eye, which he brought on to
the fourth hall with him.</p>

<p>This Vallerly had the name of being a
perfect gladiator, and this, I suppose, is the
reason why he was placed on the eleventh
as an attendant. I ever after that was
afraid of Vallerly. This hall is greatly
dreaded by the patients; is regarded as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
whipping post. I confess I always had
fears of being put there. This Reverend
gentleman expressed his high gratification
in being removed from the eleventh hall,
saying he felt raised at least fifty per cent.</p>

<p>He was free to talk of his being a minister
of the Gospel; he observed that I said
but little about my being a preacher; I
told him I did not care to say much about
it while in the asylum, not that I was
ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, but thought
it was a disgrace to the ministry to have
one of its members thrown into a lunatic
asylum. So deeply did this matter affect
me that the prefix Rev. to my name on
some of my clothing annoyed me very
much. Was this one mark of my insanity?</p>

<p>There were two or three things which
used to cause me to suspect sometimes that
my mind was not right, that I was a little
insane&#8212;yet these things haunted me more
or less for the most of the time I was there.
One of these was the fear of being put on
to the eleventh, or some one of the back
halls&#8212;another was that I should never get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
away alive, and that the life of a patient
was counted of no value in the asylum,
especially by some of the attendants, and
that many were put out of the way here;
that no one out of the institution knew, or
ever would know how they came to their
end.</p>

<p>Now I confess that if these things are
proof that I was insane, I shall have to bear
the charge, for I could not help coming to
these conclusions from what I had seen and
heard. And if these things are proof that
I was insane then, they are proof that I am
insane now, for so far as the two last things
noticed are concerned, my mind has not
been changed, viz.: that the life of a patient
in that institution is counted of no value,
and that many pass away from that place,
that the manner of their coming to their
end will never be known in this world by
the people out of that institution.</p>

<p>This may seem like a most reckless and
slanderous charge; but when it is confirmed
by testimony that cannot be reasonably disputed,
that unprincipled attendants, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
frequently knocked down feeble and insane
patients, kicked them unmercifully&#8212;dragged
them by force to the bath room, when
weak and feeble, plunged them into a cold
bath, and scrubbed them with a broom-corn
broom, throwing on soft-soap which
would come in contact with raw flesh caused
by blistering or other sores&#8212;trying to
hold their heads under water to punish
them for struggling against such harsh
treatment.</p>

<p>Besides this, choking patients until black
in the face in forcing medicine down them&#8212;locking
up patients, however sick they
may be, leaving them alone through the
long night to shift for themselves the best
way they can. If all these things can be
proved to be true&#8212;and for myself I have
not a doubt but they can be, will it be
urged that the lives of patients in that
institution are valued as they are elsewhere?</p>

<p>If such treatment as this can be proved
to be true, is it difficult to come to the conclusion
that many under such treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
sink down and die? That some patients
are treated with great care and tenderness,
is not doubted. The <i>circumstances of the
man</i> makes all the difference in the world.
Acts of violence and cruelty have been
related to me by those who were eye witnesses,
that would compare well with the
most cruel treatment in Andersonville
prison. But these witnesses were patients,
and because they were patients, their testimony
will be disputed. It is true they
were patients, but not insane at the time
they told me these things, neither were
they ever insane in a way to rob them of
their reasoning powers; I have no reason
to doubt their testimony.</p>

<p>I will here give a few instances as the
facts have been related to me, and the
reader must judge whether they are true
or false. A young man had been a patient
in the asylum, and was, when I entered it,
a young man of veracity and standing, the
son of a clergyman; he lives not far from
Utica. The name of the young man I shall
withhold. He visited the asylum perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
six months after he was discharged. He
was now in good health, and was doing
business.</p>

<p>While there he related to me the following
circumstances which took place while
he was in the institution as a patient, on
some one of the upper halls; I do not recollect
the number of the hall. He said:
&#8220;There was a poor skeleton of a man on
the hall as a patient, who did not weigh
more than about seventy pounds; that this
patient was ordered into the bath by the
attendant; that he hesitated, and struggled
to prevent going in; that the attendant
called him to his aid; that he did help the
attendant to put this poor creature into the
bath; that some force had to be used.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as I understood him the water was
cold; &#8220;they there washed and scrubbed
him as the custom was, that the man went
into spasms and died in four hours.&#8221; This
young man said, &#8220;he was sorry he helped
the attendant.&#8221; Will this relation be said
to be false?</p>

<p>Another case was: that a poor patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
was ordered to do something; he did not
instantly obey; he was thrown down by
the attendant; he struggled and showed
resistance, as the most of men would, and
especially one insane; the attendant fell
upon the breast of the patient with his
knees and broke in his breast-bone, and he
died!</p>

<p>While I was on the fourth hall, there was
a man brought there as a patient, who they
called Major Doolittle, a gentlemanly kind
of a man; I became acquainted with him;
he told me he was uncle to C. Doolittle,
Esq., of Utica, a celebrated lawyer of
that place. I left this man on the fourth
when I went to the first hall. I observed
he began to run down in health about the
time I left the hall.</p>

<p>I could never discover that he was insane;
I could never conceive why he should
come to that place; I had a hint that property
had something to do with it, as I
heard he was rich, but of this I have no
certain knowledge. He continued to run
down slowly; he was an old man, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
observed was quite notional, not more than
the most of old people generally are, however.</p>

<p>He became at length quite helpless, and
the attendant had to assist him into the
bath. There was an attendant on that hall
at that time by the name of Smith, from
North Carolina, as John Subert had now
left. This Smith was as cruel as an Arab.
I was told many things which he did;
among the rest, he would throw Major
Doolittle into the bath and scrub him with
soft soap, until he would groan horribly,
while Smith would laugh. Suffice it to say
the major died in the asylum. I understood
the cruelty of Smith was the cause of
his dismissal soon after. I know he left the
place, but as to the cause I know nothing,
only by hearsay.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>I brought down my narrative in the preceding
chapter to about August, 1864. All
things went on in about the same monotonous
manner, taking medicine three times
a day, eating three meals, working some in
the field and walking out with the attendants.</p>

<p>When September came, Sabbath school
celebrations, and picnics of various clubs
were frequently held in groves near Utica.
To these, some of the patients had frequent
invitations to go. I was generally invited
to go to these, and frequently went, but I
cannot say that I enjoyed them, I could
enjoy nothing of this kind while known
as a lunatic, in a lunatic asylum.</p>

<p>Some from there seemed to enjoy themselves
just as well as if they had been the
superintendents of the schools. There is a
state of mind that is not unfavorably affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
by placing them in the asylum&#8212;such for instance
as one under the influence of hallucinations&#8212;there
are many in that institution
who believe they own the asylum, they
think they run the institution with all its
machinery!</p>

<p>As I was there during the war of the
rebellion, I found many were brought
there through the war excitement; some believed
they were brigadier-generals; others
believed they had been in the war and in
many battles, who never saw a battle-field,
nor ever shouldered a musket.</p>

<p>On one occasion, I recollect that a large
number of patients accompanied by the
attendants were on the ground. While
there, the patients were allowed to stroll
around the grounds and mingle with the
people about as they pleased, the attendants
only taking care that they did not leave
the inclosure. I saw it was a good opportunity
for any who desired it to run away,
and I had but little doubt but on our return
home our numbers would be less than
when we came, and so it turned out; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
only shows that the great majority of
the patients are held there against their
will&#8212;this, however, is no objection to the
institution itself.</p>

<p>Another incident I also recollect which
happened on the ground at one of these
celebrations&#8212;a poor boy the son of a
widow climbed a tree, for the purpose of
fastening a rope in its top for a swing for
the children, his foot gave way and he fell
to the ground, breaking one of his legs and
receiving other very bad bruises. He was
taken up of course, placed in a carriage and
sent to his anxious mother, with a good
contribution from the people to help repair
the damage.</p>

<p>I did not run away, I felt some as Paul
did when requested to leave the prison and
would not. I recollect that in this instance
I was rather one of the privileged. I
rode to the ground in a buggy with the
Supervisor, the distance being about two
miles. This was the second time I had
taken a meal outside of the institution since
I entered it, and it seemed quite refreshing;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
more especially so, as we had such a dinner
as is never got up in the institution. I
remember of eating very heartily.</p>

<p>There is one thing which, perhaps, I
should have noticed before, but it will
come in quite as well at this stage of my
narrative. About the third day after I entered
the asylum I was sitting alone in a
very melancholy state of mind, when I saw
a man approaching me which I recognized
as an old friend in 1848 and 1849, in Columbia
county. I was shocked, I felt both
glad and sorry to see him. I rose, he took
me very cordially by the hand and said,
&#8220;Brother Chase, how do you do?&#8221; I felt
greatly embarrassed, choked up, turned
either red or pale in the face, could not tell
which, did not know what to say&#8212;I dare
not say I was well, for I was in the asylum
as a patient, and I did not feel sick, so I
stammered out&#8212;&#8220;<i>Col. Drier</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had known him when under very different
circumstances&#8212;I was the pastor of
the church in that neighborhood, he had
often heard me preach, he was also a Minister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of the gospel, and now the steward of
the asylum, and was at the time I met him
on the hall. He said a few kind words to
me, which I do not now recollect, neither
do I recollect what I said to him, if I said
anything.</p>

<p>I wish here to record, that Col. Drier,
the steward of that institution, is a <i>man</i>, a
<i>christian</i>, and a <i>gentleman</i>, always mild,
always sincere, patient to hear all the
requests of the patients, and though he
could not gratify all their whims, he nevertheless
so treated them, that all loved him,
and as soon as he appears on one of the
halls, the patients flock round him like hungry
children round their mother. I never
asked him for a thing that he denied me. I
never heard of his doing a low or a wrong
act in connection with that institution.</p>

<p>The fall passed away, and I began to
be restless that I had heard nothing from
my family since my daughter left in July,
except one letter soon after she left; this
was from Sandy Hill, where her mother
was living at that time. A letter soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
came, however, from Illinois, stating that
her mother was with her in that country.</p>

<p>On receiving this letter my mind was
greatly relieved; the mother was now with
her only child, and though widely separated,
I felt perfectly easy regarding the welfare
of my family; I was only in distress
that I could not be with them.</p>

<p>How often did I think that could the
doctors enter into my feelings for one hour,
and make them their own, that I should
soon be dismissed from the asylum. But
I now made up my mind to never say anything
more about leaving, as the doctor
once told me that my own opinion would
weigh nothing with them in relation to my
own case. I saw that a patient was a blank
in all matters of opinion.</p>

<p>It is the custom in the institution, when
the doctor enters the hall, for the inspection
of the patients, for the attendant to
walk by his side; and unless the patient is
an old fixture, and not accounted much
insane, the doctor asks the attendant the
questions he wants answered, instead of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
patient. This is, no doubt, right in many
cases, but to apply the rule as it is generally
applied, great injustice is frequently
done to the patient. The questions for
instance are: &#8220;How does he sleep nights?&#8221;
&#8220;What is his appetite?&#8221; &#8220;Does he talk
much?&#8221; &#8220;What is the state of his bowels?&#8221;
&#8220;Does he take his medicine regularly?&#8221; The
patient stands by, makes no reply; the attendant
answers all these questions. I have
stood by and heard the attendant answer
these questions in relation to my own case.
&#8220;Does he sleep well?&#8221; &#8220;Pretty well,&#8221; is
the reply of the ignoramus, looking blank
at the same time, and why should he not
look blank? What did <i>he</i> know of the
patient during the last night? The patient
was locked up in a room perhaps two
hundred feet from the room of the attendant,
and the attendant fast asleep,
while, perhaps, the patient laid and rolled
from side to side upon his couch, and never
shut his eyes during the whole night. I
have heard this answer concerning myself,
&#8220;<i>pretty well</i>,&#8221; when I knew I had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
slept one wink; and so with about all the
answers.</p>

<p>There are a good many little things in
themselves, like this, that are very annoying
to a mind that is not insane, and yet
somewhat sensitive. Being always fearful
that I might accidentally violate some rule
and thereby fall under censure, I was always
on my guard, and I can now recollect
many things in which I was over particular.</p>

<p>One small affair I do not forget; it happened
in the chapel on Sabbath evening.
The second attendant took charge of the
patients on the first hall that evening.
He was an ignorant, self-conceited, over-bearing
little Irishman. I took my seat in
the chapel as usual, and had always supposed
I knew how to behave in a church,
as I had been a preacher forty years. I
threw my arm upon the back of the seat,
and as service had not yet commenced, cast
my eye over my right shoulder; I had no
particular object in view; he saw it, and
thundered out, &#8220;Chase, turn yourself about,
and sit up in your seat.&#8221; All in the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
heard, of course. I turned my head slowly
around as though I did not hear, but I felt;
yes, I felt that if it had been any where else
than in a lunatic asylum, and he had said
it, he would have wished it had not been
him; but I never mentioned it to him afterwards;
and as he and the first attendant
soon after this had a falling out, he was discharged
and went to Canada.</p>

<p>This first attendant of the first hall is
also supervisor of a number of halls. His
name is D. Pritchards, and a better man
cannot be found for the place he occupies.
I never saw him in a surly or wrong mood
of mind, always cheerful, always kind,
never over-bearing, never delighted in afflicting
a patient; if he had any fault, it
was that he was too fraid of afflicting or
crossing a patient, or an attendant under
him. The whole house like him on all the
halls. I feel glad to give him this tribute
of regard and respect, as he always treated
me with a brotherly kindness, and did all for
me that lay in his power. I find he occupies
the same position in the institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
still, and I hope the day may be distant
when he shall leave.</p>

<p>My object in writing this sketch, is not
to find fault or pick flaws with this institution,
for there is no institution in the land
of what ever kind or character, but has its
enemies&#8212;this is all understood; but because
this is so, it does not follow that an
institution cannot become rotten, and that
the people have no right to investigate its
secret workings.</p>

<p>The winter came, the winter of 1864 and
1865, it was December, I had been occupying
a small room by myself for the last
three months, there were some reasons
why I did not like it as well as some other
rooms, yet I did not mention it as I liked
it much better than the dormitory where
I spent the winter.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly to me, the supervisor took
me by the arm and led me to a very fine
room in the center of the hall, the best
room on that floor, having a fine clothespress
and all other conveniences. He said
to me I was to have that room. I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
not see the point; I felt encouraged, for it
seemed to me that they would not let me
have that room long, so I somehow conjured
up in my mind the notion that they
meant to discharge me soon, and as another
man wanted the room I had been occupying,
they would give me this as it was not
occupied, for a few days until I were discharged&#8212;this
was a fine picture I drew in
my mind, and one that suited me&#8212;little
thinking at the time that this room was to
be my home for just one year&#8212;which was
the fact.</p>

<p>I put down my own carpet, had a good
field bedstead and good rocking chair; a
washstand, bowl and pitcher, which the
rooms did not generally have&#8212;a good new
bible was presented to me; a looking glass
and a lock on my clothespress. I could
not complain of my accommodations, and
anywhere but in an asylum, I could have
been quite happy.</p>

<p>As to the beds of the institution, no fault
could be found with them. First, a straw
tick, always kept well filled; next, a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
mattress, three good cotton sheets and
coverlids plenty, besides always next to the
sheets, thick woollen blankets for winter;
the outside one invariable a white counterpane;
the pillows were not all of feathers;
they were mostly of hair; mine, for the last
year, were feathers.</p>

<p>About this time a tall, white-haired, well
dressed man came on to the hall, acting
very cheerful, and I saw all hailed him as an
old acquaintance. He seemed to be perfectly
at home. I soon learned, by his conversation,
that he had come of his own accord
alone; he had been there the year before as
a patient, and having wintered well, and
got quite fleshy, he left; but he thought
the asylum would be a good place to winter
in again. So he came back; put himself
under the care of the doctor; gave him
his check on the bank for nine hundred
dollars as security for his keeping, and
commenced operations under high encouragements.</p>

<p>It was not long before he began to complain
that they would kill him with medicine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
this was something he had not bargained
for, as he was not sick but came to
spend the winter in a quiet way with those
he knew, as he had no family, his wife had
died and he was left alone. He remonstrated
against taking the medicine, but all was
in vain. I told him it was &#8220;good enough
for him, if after he had been there once and
knew what he knew about the institution,
to come here again of his own accord,
was a mark of madness.&#8221;</p>

<p>He would take the medicine, then swear,
and curse the doctor for forcing him to
take medicine which he did not need. He
finally made up his mind that they meant
to kill him with medicine, as they had got
his money. It was most aggravating it is
true, for the man needed no medicine, but
either the medicine or the thought of it
threw him into great agitation of mind, and
not having a very strong mind he became
nearly distracted.</p>

<p>Fearing that they meant to kill him by
dosing him, he shut himself into his room,
put his bed against the door, and barred it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the best he could. The attendants found
the next morning his door barred, and all
fast, they of course burst it open, and such
an outcry was never heard! He thought
then of course he was a gone case. He
roared and blubbered&#8212;but there was no
use, he had to take the medicine.</p>

<p>He was now removed into the dormitory
with other patients, in the same room. He
finally concluded to take the matter into his
own hands&#8212;he let me into the secret. It
was to take the medicine in his mouth and
walk carelessly away to his room or to the
washroom and spit it out; he was very successful
in this. I suppose for three months
he did not swallow a table spoonful; yet it
was given him three times a day. In the
spring his son came and took him away: he
went cursing the institution.</p>

<p>The asylum was now very full; some enlargements
were made for patients. Some
time in the fore part of this winter, as near
as I can now judge, I saw a poor skeleton
of a man come into the hall leaning on the
arm of a man on one side, and on the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
on the arm of a lady; he looked haggard,
and I thought he was in the last stages of
consumption.</p>

<p>They led him to one of the dormitories
and placed him on a bed. I thought it
strange that they would leave such a man
on the first hall, as the sick and feeble were
generally assigned to other apartments; I
soon learned the cause of this. He was a
merchant from West Port, Essex county,
and a man of some means; his disease was
dyspepsia. He was advised to go to Utica
asylum for a cure, as the doctors there
were so very skillful. He thought it like
any other hospital, that he could stay as
long as he pleased, and if things did not
work favorably he could leave when he
pleased; and as his friends brought him
there, and he paid his own bills, they wanted
him left on the first floor.</p>

<p>His friends left, and he was left there
weak and feeble as a child; I think I never
saw before a man's limbs so very small. I
pitied him; I knew he and his folks were
sold, but I dared not tell him so. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
appetite was very poor, and what he did
eat distressed him, and he was in the habit
of vomiting it up. He had a habit, when
his food hurt him, of placing his head down
lower than his body, which he thought
helped him to vomit.</p>

<p>The doctor forbade his using any means
to assist him to vomit. He was sly, and
would vomit out of the window to prevent
detection. He was soon after removed to
another hall; and on passing through that
hall a few days afterwards, I found him
bound down to his seat with straps, to prevent
his getting his head down. He looked
wishfully at me. I pitied him, but dared
not say anything to him; here he stayed
for a long time.</p>

<p>At length he was brought back upon the
first floor. His wife came to see him, but
the doctor did not permit them to meet.
He wrote to his family and read the letter
to the doctor, representing things all right,
but had a slip of paper prepared, counteracting
what was in the letter; in this slip he begged
them to come and take him away; this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
slip he put into the envelope with the
letter.</p>

<p>His wife came, and demanded to see him;
she did see him; she resolved to take him
home, but the doctor remonstrated and she
left him. This afflicted the man. He finally
got some better, and walked out with
me; for at this time I had my liberty to go
out alone, when I pleased and where I
pleased. He could not walk far at a time,
but was anxious to walk out every day.
At length he would stay out after I went
in, sometimes for half an hour&#8212;he began
now to lay his plans to run away, as the
doctor would not give his consent to let
him go. He one day stole the keys, and
came very near effecting his escape, when
he was detected. He did not deny the
fact, but told them that he did it to get
away; that he had done nothing to forfeit his
liberty; that he was under no obligations to
them; that he paid his own way.</p>

<p>His mind was now intent on leaving; he
had written home for money, and it had
been intercepted by the doctor; he resolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
to go without money. He walked out
with me as usual; he prepared himself by
putting on all the clothes he could. I
knew nothing of his plan; he lingered; I
went in; he did not come in, and has never
been in since. He went down to the depot
by a back street, went to Troy, found friends
there to help him on, and got home safe.
I doubt whether he will ever go to Utica
again to be cured of dyspepsia.</p>

<p>And though this man has a perfect dread
of the asylum, there are men, however,
who like the institution, and think it the
best place in the world. It has been urged
that those who so dislike the institution
are those whose minds are not right; they
are a little insane still, that if they were
perfectly sane they would like it&#8212;that those
who like it are sane men.</p>

<p>Let us see how this matter stands; they
that like it are sane men, and those who dislike
it are insane. I know a man who likes
the institution, who has been in it as a
patient for fifteen years; this man is known
very widely, in Utica, in Hoosick and elsewhere;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
his name is Mosely. Is he a sane
man? What does he say? He says: &#8220;It
is the best institution on the globe, and
that Dr. Gray and himself and his Bible,
and the State of New York, the asylum, his
farm in Hoosick, and his new house, are all
one thing; that they all perfectly agree,
and that it is the best institution on the
globe.&#8221; Now who can resist such an argument
as this? Such are the kind of sane
men who like the institution.</p>

<p>That there are men who work in and around
the institution, and have for years, who see
nothing very exceptionable in any of its departments,
may be all true. So there may
be men who are employed in and around
State prisons, who see nothing very exceptionable
in them. But this proves nothing
at all.</p>

<p>There is a vast difference between skinning
or being skinned. Let those who
have been in and around the institution,
and think they know all about it, let them
go in as patients, let them go through all
the degrees of initiation, until they get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
diploma, then ask them whether they can
recommend it to the world as the best
institution on the globe?</p>

<p>As I wish to give credit for every good
thing which happened during my stay in
the asylum, and as I have passed over one
thing, I wish, before I enter upon my last
summer's history; to notice it.</p>

<p>The thing referred to, which was passed
over in its proper connection, was our
Thanksgiving dinners of 1863 and 1864.
I was on the fourth hall at the dinner of
1863. I think it was about the 20th of November.
I thought it a grand dinner; fifty
turkeys were dressed, stuffed and cooked
for that dinner for the patients.</p>

<p>I took a kind of philosophical view of it
when it came on the table. The first
thought was, after taking a glance at the
whole thing, <i>what a contrast</i>. Now it must
be understood that our common every day
fare was a very stereotyped edition. It
was bread and meat, and meat and bread,
with a little butter, twice a day, and cheese,
pickle, and pie, Sundays only; and I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
always glad when Sunday came, for the
sake of the pickle and cheese, though the
cheese was a very small piece. I am not
fault finding, only noticing the contrast.
There was a fine roasted turkey on each
end of the table, bread, butter, cheese,
pickle, pie of the richest kind, roast beef;
then came on nuts, confectioneries in abundance,
with raisins and apples.</p>

<p>I think I must have been a little &#8220;luny&#8221;
just at that time, for I confess I was so
afraid that some of us would over-eat of
this rich dinner, that ten to one if we did
not have half a dozen deaths in less than
eight and forty hours afterwards; for this
dinner was not confined to one or two halls,
but was general. At all events, I was so
afraid of making myself sick, that I was
foolishly reserved in eating; I ate scarcely
any of the turkey, and, by the way, I never
liked turkey; I ate no pie, I thought it was
too rich; I made my dinner of stuffing,
sauce, bread, butter, and confectioneries.
I was not sick, and I heard of no deaths on
that account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>The next Thanksgiving dinner, of 1864,
was on the first hall. It did not make so
deep an impression on my mind as the first,
for it was not exactly like it, we had no
turkey, nor butter for that dinner; but we
did have a very good dinner, with a dessert
and confectioneries to close up with.</p>

<p>Another spring now came, the spring of
1865; I had made up my mind to go no
more out to work; I had got above work
by this time, though I was better able to
work now than I was the year before; yet
if I had been ordered out, I suppose I
should have went, but very little would
have been the work I should have done;
as it was, however, I was not ordered out.</p>

<p>I had quit the dining room six months
before this, except to eat my meals, as the
Supervisor had told me I need not work
there longer unless I pleased; so I quit it,
and took to sweeping the hall for exercise
every morning after breakfast. There were
a number of men on the hall who were
excessive eaters, but not one chore could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
be got out of them, except to make their
beds and sweep their rooms.</p>

<p>The floor of the hall had to be scrubbed
and washed every Monday morning; this
gave us a little good exercise. The cleaning
of house came on this spring, as usual;
this is quite a business; the patients can
have employment in this for a number of
days. While this is going on no visitors
are received. The windows are all taken
out and washed, the mouldings and casings
all scoured, the bedsteads all taken out of
their rooms, the beds put into a pile and
the bedsteads scoured and thoroughly saturated
with kerosene, to prevent the vandals
from eating up the patients. All the
rooms are then whitewashed.</p>

<p>The bedsteads are prepared with strips
of sheet-iron instead of cords to lay the beds
on; this, perhaps, is an improvement.</p>

<p>One particular incident I cannot pass
over without recording. Some time in the
course of the fall or winter of 1864-5&#8212;I
cannot be particular here as to the exact
time&#8212;Dr. Gray came on the hall accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
by a man in regimentals; a dark, curly
black-haired man, rather slim, but carrying
a decided look and apparently a firm will,
and, as I inspected him from a distance, he
looked to me, as though he could hew a
man in pieces with all the <i>sang froid</i> of a
Roman gladiator.</p>

<p>The doctor introduced him as Dr. Shantz,
a surgeon from the army, and from this
time was to be the attending physician on
this side of the house. I had dreaded the
one we had before, but now I thought we
had got a Rehoboam, who declared &#8220;his
little finger should be thicker than his
father's loins; that whereas his father had
chastised them with whips, he would chastise
them with scorpions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Such were the views I had of Dr. Shantz
when I first saw him. He commenced his
rounds of visitation, but I shunned him as
far as I was able to do so, till some observed
it, and thought I treated the doctor with
great coldness. I was afraid of him.</p>

<p>At length we came in contact. I found
he had a good mind, penetrating and scientific;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
I found he loved books, and was a
good observer of nature, and withal was
not an infidel; my fears fled. I soon found
that he could not only reason, but was
willing to hear others. After I had
thoroughly weighed him in my own mind,
I resolved on an experiment. For more than
a year and a half I had now taken medicine
three times a day, and was now, besides
this, drinking strong beer before every
meal, as to the medicine I had no doubt
but it injured me, and I felt that I was like
a candle burning at both ends, the pressure
of the asylum on the one hand and the
medicine on the other.</p>

<p>And so I contrived to evade taking it, by
spitting it out. I confess I did this for
more than three months, and I knew I felt
the better for it. I will not stop now to
argue the question of the right or wrong
of my course, as I was not treated as a moral
agent. I simply state facts as they were.</p>

<p>I told the doctor I would like to have
an interview with him in my room if he
would admit it. He said he would do so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and not long after this he came to my room
and gave me a fair opportunity to tell him
all that was in my heart.</p>

<p>I gave him a brief history of my coming
into the asylum, the causes that led to it as
far as I knew, what my feelings and state
were before, and at the time I came there;
how matters had gone on with me since I
had been there; what my appetite was, my
general state of health, and how I felt at
that time; and closed by telling him that
it appeared strange to me, that the manner
of doctoring here should be different from
the manner out of the institution.</p>

<p>In this particular I referred to the continuance
of medicine of the same kind for
a year or more, three times a day, without
reference to the state of the patient. I told
him that it appeared to me that when a
man was well and appetite good, he did
not need medicine; and finally begged him
to take it all off.</p>

<p>The medicine was dropped off, and oh! how
I rejoiced, not that I had swallowed it for
the last three months, yet the idea that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
was no longer offered me was a great relief.
The bloating of my bowels and limbs ceased,
and I felt much better. When it was
no longer offered me, I felt like a new man,
and hope sprang up in my mind. The
beer was still continued; after a while I
introduced this subject to the doctor.</p>

<p>I told him I felt quite well, and I could
not see that I needed beer for my health,
and begged him to take it off. He thought
I was mistaken about its not benefitting
me, but said he would take off the beer and
substitute a little sherry, with an egg, three
times a day. I begged to be excused from
taking the wine; so he took off the beer,
and from that time until I left the institution,
which was perhaps three or four
months, I took nothing, and I know I felt
the better for it.</p>

<p>So I found in Dr. Shantz a &#8220;man, a gentleman
and a friend.&#8221; I could not have been
more kindly treated by an own brother
than by him. When I left the institution,
I felt that I had left behind a friend and a
benefactor. I think him just the man for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
such an institution. I have had one very
agreeable visit with him since I left the
asylum.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>He left the institution at Utica since I
left there, went to Minnesota and founded
an asylum in that State, of which he takes
the charge. I understand he is doing well.
If I am so unfortunate as to go to a lunatic
asylum again, I beg my friends to take me
to Minnesota and place me under the charge
of Dr. Shantz, but never take me to Utica.</p>

that if he had been one of the physicians who examined
my case before I was sent there, he should not have
admitted it.</p></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>I think it was in the spring of 1865 that
I saw a man walking up the hall, who I
recognized as an old friend from Fort Plain;
we had been warm friends for a number of
years; I had once been stationed there, as
their pastor. Anticipating what he might
think of my state of mind, I said to him the
very first word, that I wanted him to look
upon me as the same man that I used to
be, and not to talk to me as though he
thought I were insane.</p>

<p>The meeting was affecting to both of us.
He took dinner with me. He had a talk
with Dr. Gray about the propriety of my
leaving the institution soon. I accompanied
him to the depot when he left, and I
am sure he was satisfied that I was not
insane. Since I left the institution I have
visited him twice, and once spent with him
an agreeable Sabbath, in preaching in the
same house that I did in 1850 and 1851.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>August came, and the 23d of August
came. Two years had now rolled round
since I entered the asylum. I had said
nothing about leaving since my daughter
left, which was now more than a year
before. My general impression had been,
ever since I entered the asylum, that I
should never leave it alive; but, for a month
or two before the two years had elapsed,
hope had begun to spring up in my mind;
and when the two years were ended I
hoped the doctor would tell me I could
leave. But no such welcome message came,
till at length, about the 23d of August, I
said to the doctor that two years had now
passed since I came there, and if I were
ever to leave, I though the time had fully
come. He replied very promptly, that
&#8220;the two years had nothing to do with it;
that when I got well I should go.&#8221; &#8220;Get
well!&#8221; I replied, &#8220;if I am to wait for that
I do not know when it will be, for I did
not know that I was sick.&#8221; I then said:
&#8220;Doctor, do you think I shall ever get
away from here?&#8221; He answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> &#8220;Yes;
there are some things we do know, and we
know you will go away.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, I
know, too, that I shall get away, either dead
or alive; but how long, doctor, do you
think it will be before I can go?&#8221; He
answered, &#8220;Two or three months, if you
get well, and your folks come after you.&#8221;
I said no more, but I stuck a pin down
there. &#8220;Two or three months,&#8221; I repeated
to myself; it seemed short to think of.</p>

<p>I now felt that I had some grounds to
hope; the time was limited to two or three
months. Time now began to hang more
lightly upon me. Mr. Harvey visited me
during this fall, this is the man who was
my attendant, when I went to the asylum.
He observed that I was more like myself,
that I appeared more life-like. And why
should I not appear more like living? the
medicine was taken off, the time was limited
to three months, that I was to have my
liberty once more and go where I pleased.</p>

<p>There was a man by the name of Fenton,
a patient who used to accompany me in my
rambles this fall, through the forests,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
fields and city. He was one of those eccentric,
poetic, wiry, excitable creatures that
would astonish you with his outbursts of
wit and humor, making a very agreeable
companion to help while away the gloomy
hours spent in an asylum.</p>

<p>I left him in the menagerie, as he used
to call the asylum, when I left; but I learnt
that he soon after got away, and has written
me two or three times since, sending
me some of his poetic productions, which
will compare well with our best American
poetry.</p>

<p>As the time drew nigh for me to leave,
the steward took me down to the city and
told me to select just such a suit of clothes
as I chose. I, of course, got me a good suit,
with hat and boots. I was now prepared
to leave, so far as I was concerned, with
the exception of money.</p>

<p>When the three months were out, which
brought it to the 20th of November, I reminded
the Doctor of his promise. &#8220;Yes,
yes,&#8221; he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> &#8220;I have written to your son
to come after you from Illinois; when he
comes you can go.&#8221; I thought of the matter.
I wrote to my folks to not come after
me. I felt indignant that my friends should
be required to come a thousand miles and
spend a hundred dollars to accompany me
back, when I knew I was just as capable
of traveling alone as I ever was.</p>

<p>I sent to a friend for money. He sent
me a draft. I told the Doctor my friends
were not coming after me; that I was capable
of traveling alone, and that I must start
by the 20th of December, as I did not want
to stay through another winter. Besides,
I wanted to be with my friends during the
holidays. He tried to prevail on me to
stay another week.</p>

<p>I told him my clothes were packed in
my trunk; that I had written to my friends
that I should be there about that time, and
I could see no reason why I should stay
longer. I told the steward I must go to
the city and get a few things before I
started. I did so.</p>

<p>The last supper was now ended that I
ever expected to eat in that house, as I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
to start at eleven o'clock that evening for
the west. At the close of the supper, a
call was made for a speech from me before
I left. The call was sudden and I was
embarrassed, as I had not spoken in public
in two years and six months. My own voice
was strange to me.</p>

<p>I rose and addressed the company, about
forty in number, they all seated at the
table, with a few impromptu remarks. I
referred to the length of time I had been
there; that I had sat just two years in the
same place at table, the changes that had
taken place, the trials we had passed
through, and encouraged them to hope on
for their deliverance. I bade them all good-bye,
with the best and most kindly feelings
of sympathy, I trust, on both sides.</p>

<p>When the hour to depart arrived, the
supervisor and house steward accompanied
me to the depot, carrying with them a box
of the choicest kinds of eatables for my
accommodation on my journey. A sleeping-car
was engaged, the signal was given
to move; I shook my old keepers heartily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
by the hand, bidding them good-bye with
unfeigned good feeling, and shot out of
their sight&#8212;took my berth, and waked up
in the morning in Buffalo.</p>

<p>I continued my journey through Ohio,
around the lake to Chicago, and from
thence on the great Central to the place of
my destination, and found my family and
friends in good health. But, oh, the change!
To sit down in a private room by the side
of a stove, with my own children, once more
to eat with them at the table, to retire
when I pleased without hearing that old
stereotyped sound&#8212;&#8220;<i>Bed time, gents</i>;&#8221; to
go out and in as I pleased, furnished
grounds for the most profound gratitude
to him, who had so mysteriously preserved
me without harm through all my dangers
and fears, and who had brought me safe to
once more see my loved ones, and enjoy
their society without fear of interruption.</p>

<p>And now, in the close, I have only to
say, that, though it may be humiliating to
spread abroad the knowledge that I have
been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, yet, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
by publishing this sketch, the people in
general shall become better informed of the
true character of asylum life, and thereby
prevent the suffering of some poor, unfortunate
victim to mental disease, I shall be
amply compensated for all my humiliation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>P.S. Although my history is closed,
yet there are a few things of a miscellaneous
character, that I ought to notice, to make
the narrative complete.</p>

<p>One is, that very much was said about
the violation of the rules of the institution;
patients were continually admonished not
to violate the rules. I was very fearful
that I might, by some mistake or oversight,
violate the rules; I therefore sought to
find out just what these rules were, that I
might know the law. In doing this I became
perplexed. I could find no code of
laws or rules that were fixed, that could be
possibly violated. I found a law, or rather
a custom that amounted to law, which was
fixed and unalterable, and there was no
danger of this being violated. This was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
that the patients must retire at just such
an hour and rise at just such a time in the
morning; that they must eat at just such a
time, take medicine at just such a
time, and no man would dare to violate
these rules unless he loved punishment.</p>

<p>As to all other rules, I found them as
variable as the circumstances of the patients
were various. What one could do with
impunity, I found was a violation of the
rules by another. I was at first perplexed
with this, yet the patients were constantly
warned not to violate the rules. All the
rules there were was the will and word of
the doctor, who made rules and changed
them just as he saw fit.</p>

<p>There was another thing held up very
prominently to the patients, and also to outsiders.
This was, that patients are not
obliged to work either in the house or in
the field, unless they chose to do so, and
that no coercion is used either by the
attendants or superintendents.</p>

<p>And this doctrine some believe; and
indeed it is true with a qualification, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
that qualification spoils it. The fact is
simply this, that if a patient is told to do
a thing whether it is to work in the house
or in the field, that if that patient does it,
all is well&#8212;if not, the patient must take
the consequences, perhaps that patient is
changed to some other hall, provided he
or she is on the first, or some other lower
hall; but suppose a patient is on the ninth
or tenth or the old eleventh hall, and is
told to do something and refuses?</p>

<p>Perhaps they would not be removed, for
to remove them would be no punishment;
but would the attendants on these halls
submit to it? No one had better believe
this. It is precisely in the asylum as it
was in a certain school in this country; a
boy was punished for violating the rules of
the school, the teacher punished him; the
boy made complaint to his father; his father
told him he need not obey the rules of the
school unless he chose to, but must go
back to school.</p>

<p>The boy returned the next day and was
punished again; he again made complaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
to his father, the father still told him that
he need not obey the teacher unless he
chose to do so, but must return to school,
he went the third day and was punished as
before, he again made complaint to his
father. His father then told him that he
need not obey the rules of the school unless
he chose to do so, if he preferred punishment,
rather them to obey, but to school
he must go.</p>

<p>By this time the boy waked up; he saw
it was punishment or obedience; so with
patients in the asylum, they are not obliged
to work unless they choose to do so.
But it is a base deception to pretend that
patients are not obliged to work in the
asylum.</p>

<p>I would recommend that all men who
are sent to the asylum be permitted and advised
to let their beards grow, and not
shave at all during their stay there,
especially on any other hall except the
first, for the attendants do all the shaving;
the patient is not permitted to shave himself,
except on one or two of the halls, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
so far as my experience goes, it is more like
skinning than shaving; the razors are horrible
things, as one of the attendants said
to me &#8220;he should get it off unless the
handle of the razor broke.&#8221; I then understood
the saying, &#8220;that it is easier to skin
than to be skinned.&#8221;</p>

<p>While confined in my prison-house my
mind was continually haunted with the
&#8220;Lament of Tasso,&#8221; and that the outside
world may have a faint idea of my feelings
while there, I will append a few extracts
from that work:<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

Ferrara the letters of Tasso, and saw the cell in the hospital

charged him with insanity, and threw him into this prison.
The manner of treating insane persons in the Old World
has been awfully cruel, so far as history gives any clue to
the subject. Byron's Lament of Tasso is, no doubt, correct;
but this is no reason why in this enlightened age, in

<h2><a name="TESTIMONIALS" id="TESTIMONIALS">TESTIMONIALS.</a></h2>


<p>This is to certify that the Rev. Hiram Chase, a
supernumerary member of the Troy Annual Conference
of the M.E. Church, resided at Saratoga
Springs for one year preceding the spring of 1867;
that at the session of his Conference, held that spring,
he took an effective relation, and, at the request of the
Catharine Street church, Saratoga Springs, was appointed
its pastor, and that he faithfully and efficiently
discharged the duties of his pastorate&#8212;facts, these,
which speak for themselves regarding both his mental
and his moral status.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Albany</span>, Aug. 4, 1868.</p>

<p>I have this day listened attentively, and not without
as deep emotion as my nature is susceptible of, to Rev.
H. Chase's two years and four months in the asylum.
I regard said narrative as the unvarnished statement
of facts as they occurred during his residence there. I
have enjoyed a pleasant acquaintance with the Rev. H.
Chase for the last thirty years, and have ever known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
him to be the same truthful, ingenuous and trustworthy
friend, faithful and successful minister of Christ,
and a Christian gentleman of more than ordinary culture
and refinement. It is an occasion of most devout
thanksgiving to Almighty God that he has been mercifully
preserved during the past and restored again to
his family and many friends, to the fellowship of the
church in which he has spent half a century of sacrifice
and toil, to her pulpits and altars, and a large
place in the best affections of thousands of brethren
and fellow-laborers in the church of the living God.</p>

<p>In my opinion the narrative should be printed and
widely circulated.</p>
